"So don't use the app. Because that is a scam, for them to not send you your order properly, or miss your order, or not even send you anything.There is no option in the app to complain. If you try very hard you can sometimes get to a spot where they'll try to let you but then they will stymie you by sending you in a circular pattern.They don't want to hear your complaints. And I don't want to do anything about them. I have the receipts to prove this",1,restaurant,Subway
I went into the store to buy a small bowl of steak and chicken for my sick dog that hadn't eaten in 3 days so I started by trying to explain I have a sick dog that hadn't eaten in 3 days and I needed a small bowl of something she could eat the lady rudely ask me do you have money to pay for it I replied yes what do I look homeless or something she said well then let's pay for it first I said ok is that new or different she says it will just be easier for me is there a problem mind you she said this really crappy time I said yes there is a problem your the problem and I will see to it that you get fired and I left without buying anything now I'm trying to reach corperate to file a complaint against this woman who treated me like crap like I couldn't pay for what I wanted to order and I can't even get in touch with corperate. I have never been treated like this from anybody and by the way no I'm not homeless I own the business across the street from this location,1,restaurant,Subway
"Online order decided to change my location and the order went to the wrong store.  I tried to contact the store and the lady on the phone told me, ""That sucks"" and hung up the phone.I will never ever order from Subway again.  When the online order system screws up, they refuse to refund the customer.",1,restaurant,Subway
"All I wanted was olives.Warm olives.Chopped into perfect little rings of happiness.But no... they refused to add six extra portions. And then the guy told me to ""just buy a jar"".A jar?? Cold?? In oil??I'm ordering a sandwich, not stocking a pantry!For an olive lover like me, this was heartbreaking. Truly a Greek tragedy.",1,restaurant,Subway
"I don’t know what’s going on at this Subway, but clearly accuracy is not part of the training program. I placed a very simple order. They managed to get it wrong. Fine, mistakes happen. I went back, explained the issue politely, and expected a quick fix.Somehow, unbelievably, they got it wrong again.At that point it became obvious this wasn’t an accident but a complete lack of attention and basic competence. I wasted time, money, and patience on something that should take less than five minutes. If an order with clear instructions can’t survive two attempts, that says everything.",1,restaurant,Subway
"Very disappointed in the sandwich. Bread was so hard and dry I could eat the last 2 inches on either end of the sandwich. There wasn't hardly any meat in it (I literally had to open it up and look for it) and veggies were wrong. The bread was even smaller than usual, it was really small. What a joke. I will have a hard time ever going back to Subway after this.",1,restaurant,Subway
"I ordered 2 sandwiches for dinner , when I went to unwrap the sandwich I noticed the bread looked different and very much like a hot dog bun.When I bit into the sandwhich it was very difficult to bite into.One of the things that kept subway on our list was the bread and this was not it.I called the store to find out if it was toasted an the clerk informed me the bread has been changed! Bad call subway you lost this customer!",1,restaurant,Subway
"They started a new promo, so they eliminated all my points. I can't wait for the day SUBWAY fails miserably. I know people will lose jobs, and I feel bad. The hedge fund that purchased SUBWAY sucks. All they care about is bottom line. The food is ultra processed, and additives that are not safe to your body. The only thing SUBWAY is safe to is your toilet. 2 companies that are abusing the consumer is SUBWAY, and DOMINOS. Hopefully these 2 fade away like the old K-MART.",1,restaurant,Subway
"Rude and argumentative staff, food quality terrible",1,restaurant,Subway
"I am not a regular at Subway but was feeling festive I wanted to try the christmas sub as advertisment made it look amazing. Not the case in real life. Mines looked a mess. I was already concerned after watching the construction of the sub. It resembled a roll in stuffing paste which had been dropped from a height. It was also warm on outside, cold in middle, it was also missing some of the main ingredients, as well as taste. Very poor attempt and was very disapointed.",1,restaurant,Subway
"Firstly - your app is shocking.It's so glitchy and slow. It also has an odd habit of omitting biometric which is enabled leaving me to guess the password. Which of course I can't. I set a difficult password so it means resetting.I don't need that when I'm at the store in a rush.It actually puts me off visiting a store.Then there's the store .....there's absolutely no care from the staff.They look bored and grunt when asked a question.What's dished up is a pale imitation of what's displayed on your glossy ads.It seems all fast food outlets are much the same.A well known burger joint in my area is appaling.Again, what's thrown out is monstrous.My branch is Finsbury Park in London.What with the dire app and the below average food I doubt I'll be visiting again any time soon.",1,restaurant,Subway
Got a sandwich with no fillingSales person was rudeNot the experience I was expecting,1,restaurant,Subway
They suck tried to call them. Tell them about a problem it said they mailbox full the one in buckingham how the heck you gonna run a business with full mailbox really couldn't even get no one in the phone,1,restaurant,Subway
First of all the lady making my sub was super unfriendly. Apparently her customers were a burden. I had a 6 inch steak and cheese...what a joke. This small scoop of cheese with the tiniest amounts of vegetables and priced like you are getting quality. Thanks for the expensive bread!! It has been a few years since I have gone there and it will be a life time before I ever go again for this exact reason.Subways across the board need to do better!,1,restaurant,Subway
"Portishead branch. Only 2 machines out of 4 working. Then Machine I was ordering on froze. Both staff totally ignored me when I tried to speak to them..after third attempt, and them both still ignoring me, I walked out. ..absolutely disgusting treatment to customers. Will never go in there again.",1,restaurant,Subway
"Absolutely disgusting! Advertising ""any size pizza from £7.99"" to find out that real price is £16. Its a joke",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
Worst experience EVER.  WAS WAITING IN DRIVE THROUGH FOR OVER AN HR. AND PIZZA WAS SUPPOSED TO TO BE READY OVER AN HR AGO. THEY COME TO THE DRIVE THROUGH AND SAY HEY.  I TOLD THEM MY NAME. AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK. THE PEOPLE IN THE PIZZA HUT ARE ALL GETTING THE WRONG ORDERS AND GIVING OUT COLD PIZZAS. THIS IS A FREEKING JOKE OF A BUSINESS IN ROCKMART GEORGIA. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Food was hours late, cold and crushed",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
What's access to my account because they took away the password login and I didn't update my phone number because I never used my telephone number on the app so I had no reason to update it so I lost all my points because they decided to update something that nobody asked for! on the app so I had no reason to update it so I lost all my points because they decided to update something that nobody asked for!,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
would give 0 if i could! The pizza and garlic bread was cold and the delivery was late. The ice- cream had melted and the top opened when it was delivered so went straight in the bin. Will not be using pizza hut again.,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
Pizza wasn't that great and wasn't cut properly at all they also almost forgot to give us our drinks and there were pepperonis on the side that wasn't supposed to have any.,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Beyond there app being totally worthless, having and order out for delivery for over an hour you know exactly what I received. Cold crappy food. The worst part is Pizza Hut requires a tip at time of purchase.Done with this crap place, deleted app and disputed charge with credit card company",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Please don’t do it, order from Pizza Hut, we’ve been waiting 2 hours. No Bournemouth based Pizza Hut is answering their phones, a complete fiasco. I’m ending my relationship with this Cowboy Company they must be on the way out.",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I ordered 1 pan Canadian bacon, pineapple, jalapeño, onion  and 1 pan meat lovers.I got 1 hand tossed  ham, jalapeño and onion and 1 thin pork and pepperoni with no sauceThey were more worried about hanging Christmas lights, than taking care of customers .Too high, poor quality, customer service.I won’t make that mistake again!!",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
Pizza Hut on Wilma Rudolph in Clarksville Tn is the worst Ever!!!!!!!!!!! Second time ordering and will be the last time!I wish I could upload a photo  43 dollars for burnt dry trash pizza!! Cashiers have  no hospitality and no customer service skills what so ever are horrible managers are horrible .,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
Terrible service. Still get spam despite unsubscribed 3 times. How many times do I have to do it to stop getting  those spam emails?,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
I placed an order today for two tavern style pizza’s and chicken Alfredo it was the worst meal ever it was definitely not worth what I paid for and ended up giving it to someone but they also said they did not like !,1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I ordered a pizza with NO sauce and PLANT BASED CHEESE because I am intolerant to tomato and dairy. You have 3 options, BBQ sauce, Tomato sauce or leave the tick box blank (I have done this many times) however I received a pizza with dairy cheese and tomato sauce on. I contacted through Uber and received no reply. No refund and will have to get a chargeback. I also starved tonight and had no food.",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"For the Love of God AVOID Them. This is the third time our order shows delivered but hasn’t actually left the restaurant. I can assess them in 3 words, sad, sad, sad. And the quality of the food, sub-standard.",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I ordered a pizza from Westcliff-on-Sea branch at 20.35 pm. Received email to confirm estimated delivery time between 2100 to 2110. I have been sent text messags, uber driver is at my address...its nearly 2200 hours!!!  Driver never turned up and received another message notifying me the order had been cancelled.  Called the store to be told they dont know why driver didn't arrive and sending another pizza. Its past 2200 hours..over 1 and 1/2 hours later and still waiting. Appalling service, will not be ordering from here again.Please note the person at the westcliff store was sympathetic and patient. However, it doesnt help me.",1,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Well, on an average me and my daughter go there once or twice a month to have lunch and it’s always been good except for yesterday. This is the most horrible food I’ve ever tasted and it’s the only reason why is because everything was basically burnt. I can’t remember what I ordered, but she ordered a three selections and so did I But that was horrible. I mean it’s not even edible and there is three people working there, but it was yesterday probably around 11 that we were there so that way you can check the employees that we’re working and I’m in Medford Oregon. I didn’t go up and say anything to them because they all look angry lol sorry. But they did anyways it would be nice to be compensated for this and I don’t mean get money back but get two more meals that’s great because I’m sure it’s not gonna be burnt the next time.Thank you so much, Brenda",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"4765 Weitzel St, Timnath County. We arrived at 9:30 and they only had 3 types of stews, and one of them was dry. The food didn't look good at all. I really don't recommend it. The service was also bad; they were annoyed because they had to make more food even though the closing time is 10:30. The business closing time was very poor. In my experience...",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
Do not go apply for a job at this place the lady that owns the store will not hire people over 40 to work in front of the store this is discrimination I will never eat her again and I intend to file a complaint with a better Business bureau and the Labor commission,1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I rarely get the opportunity to eat out, so imagine how excited I was when I pulled up to Panda Express. I ordered my favorite, 2 walnut shrimp entrees and a side, LISTED ON MENU for $10.50.The girl taking my order asked if I was aware of the $1.50 up-charge for 'P'remium items. I asked where it stated this in the menu. She stated it was, however, there is ZERO mention of ANY extra charge. I asked her why she was trying to extort extra money from me for the item listed at $10.50. She said it was 'policy'. I asked her where this 'policy' was stated on the menu... it isn't. What the hell?? I told her I would pay the extra if the policy was listed on the menu. She started trying to explain the up-charge again.I told her, keep your food, I'll take my business to another Chinese restaurant that doesn't try to charge more than their menu prices.",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
When I stepped up to the counter the server nearest me turned to his associate to continue his conversation.  I complained and left.  The Teriyaki place across the street got my business.,1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I would do zero stars if I could. Panda Express in Redmond WA. Don't order delivery. First off they want a tip before you even receive your food. Secondly if the tip is not enough they won't even deliver. Just say you put no tip and had cash, they miss out on  Money they attitudes towards delivery seemingly are desperate for and hender them from getting, also risking bad reviews which obviously Panda Express loves or they would do better. Next .. I also guess Panda Express would rather lose customers lmao, than to tell their friends and family who deliver to respect their business. Another lmao cause I won't EVER have another problem with Panda Express because I'm done with them period, whether delivery pick up or dine in! I hope they realize in WA State, there are dozens of restaurants that serve what they CALL Chinese food.... Again lmmfao",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I placed an order through the app and it wasn't ready when I arrived. It was for one meal, so there's no excuse. How is it that all these other people that order through the drive thru can get get their meals right away, and I couldn't with the mobile order?",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Once again the Piece of SHIT store failed . I will never go back, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. They opened for maybe an hour, I ordered, they didnt have it 10 minute wait, I ordered something else, they DIDNT have it, 7 minute wait. She told me, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, WE JUST OPENED AN HOUR AGO. LMAO... Never again. The last time I got food from the Centenial las vegas store it was Terrible. Sloppy and tasted like crap, I tossed it in the trash. Stay away from this place.",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Noodles we're horribly under cooked. Teriyaki chicken, which is usually fantastic, had zero flavor. Used to go there all the time and be happy. All in all, just bad food. Actually signed up for the Panda Express app yesterday and dropped it the very next morning. EVERYONE, PASS THIS ONE OR YOU WILL BE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Terrible service, especially  regarding their dishes. I ordered a broccoli  and beef plate, and I only received two slices of beef! I will not be going back..",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Sad to say that when your 1star reviews are 69% badand your 5 star reviews are 10%,,, Look at what people think of Panda,,, Be shamed by those numbers, we all know Panda will Never Change and get better for customers, they dont care what the reviews say or how many customers that they loose every day for the terrible Service, customer service and the nasty food.  Very Sad I went to the drive thru Centennial Center in Las Vegas and was the only car , 2 cars came in behind me, I ordered drove up to the window, the lady looked at me, set my food on the counter and went to the cash register, she took orders from the two cars behind me, set up their trays , all the time ignoring me and my food getting Ice cold sitting there. She ignored me for 10 minutes while getting the other people food, mine getting colder so I started my hummer looked at the lady again and as I put my car in drive she started over to the window but I drove Away and would tell everyone to drive Away when Panda Ignores you and lets your food get cold, Let the lady eat it, instead, it goes back in the pan to the next customer, Like Slopping the Hogs.. . Dont go here Las Vegas Centennial Center.",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I thought I was ordering spring rolls but I got mushy garlic rolls, yuk!",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Eating at a place like that my standards are generally low, but the Culver Center location in Los Angeles lowered that bar even more.  Louzy service, louzy food and trying to rip me off on top of it by charging me for an item I ordered by they ran out of and the server didn't bother telling me.  When I asked her why I paid for an order I didn't get she snapped ""We don't have any!""  Unreal.  Can not figure out why this place is so popular.",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
Do not go to panda express on e nine mile rd Pensacola.  They do not speak food look very old. No one spoke we walked out would not have feed my dog there.,1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"What went wrong is my food was delivered to the wrong address? And I couldn't get ahold of the delivery. Driver, he wasn't picking up this phone or answering the text messages. I called panda, spoke to the manager and he said there was nothing he could do so I was out $32.  And out the food he told me to call DoorDash.Because even though the app was panda's DoorDash ran it.The number he gave me was busy all night long!!!!!!! I won't ever go back.There's too many fast foods and I won't recommend it to anybody.They were rude inconsistent.And I'm on a fixed income and 68 years old.I don't need to be treated this way!!!!!!¡!",1,restaurant,Pandaexpress
The Customer service at the Dunkin near Lake Clarke Shores is consistently horrible. If they mess up the order it’s my fault for saying it wrong. Even if my receipt is also saying it. Then they are angry with me for making them redo it and then they redo wrong anyway. I just have to accept it and move on. I will gladly go out of my way for Starbucks from now on. As I prefer their coffee and employees better!,1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"⭐ 1 Star ReviewI visited the Dunkin’ Donuts on Alfreton Road, Nottingham on 11/11/2025 at around 6:45 PM, and unfortunately, I had a very disappointing experience.One of the staff members — an Asian man, around 45–50 years old — was extremely rude to me. I only asked for an extra cup, and he charged me 50p, which is fine if that’s the policy, but the way he spoke to me was very unprofessional and disrespectful.I usually come to this branch often and have always been happy with the service, but this time it was very unpleasant. I hope the management looks into this and ensures customers are treated with more respect in the future.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Stopped to get a dozen lemon filled donuts, I was told they have been discontinued. I ask for a dozen chocolate filled donuts and was told they were discontinued.I was offered some old cream filled donuts 😂Good bye Dunkin’ Donuts",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"We went inside to order and the staff were all stood chatting and laughing when we were waiting at the counter to order, the wait times on the drinks were extremely long and even though it was busy the staff didnt seem to rush. i tried to order with my student discount where i was told i had to get the app in which she ended up making me the wrong drink and i therefore couldnt drink it as it was not what i wanted. there were 4 of us that went and all of us were extremely disappointed in this experience as many people who ordered before us had there orders finished before we got ours",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"355 Broadway, Amityville, NY 11701 Now Wednesday August 27th we went to buy Ice Coffee at that store but the people who are there especially two Hispanic girls are very disgusting and they speak very badly to the people also the manager who is there is very disgusting when you tell him not to put too much ice they say that it is a rule and that they can't take away the ice and they put too much ice in the coffee and they speak to him in a very bad way",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"We ordered the value breakfast - 2 wraps and a coffee.  Then we added an iced Signature Latte and 2 Boston Creme donuts.  The latte tasted good, just too much ice and too costly.  We went through the drive thru so we took the ice out when we got home so it didn't water down the drink.  The wraps were a little chewy on the edges.  The cheese tasted weird.  The donuts were good and not as expensive as Sheetz donuts have become.  The coffee that I ordered with the meal was just a medium hot coffee with creamer in.  It was watered down and did not taste very good.  The service was friendly, though.  Don't think I'll be going back.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Ordered online for a holiday treat for the kids. Received a box of squashed melted garbage. Would add photos if I could. Unbelievably gross. Dunkin immediately promised a refund, 2 weeks later no refund and are now ignoring me. Never again. Krispy Kreme has much better customer service",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Ordered for my fellas 40th birthday as a birthday cake alternative. When they arrived on the day it looked liked they'd been run over repeatedly (including delivery this eyesore had cost me over £40).I put in a complaint to customer services, their original reply was quick and said they would issue a refund. It's been getting on for 2 weeks now and still no refund, only an email saying as they hadn't heard from me in 96 hours since that email are they to take the issue as being resolved? I replied no, as to date I haven't received my money back. Since that email i haven't heard from them since, and even tried opening up another complaint to match the other which they're choosing to not reply to either.Absolutely disgusting customer service, I dont understand how this company has got so big.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"The worst. I always order ahead on the app and walk up to the Dunkins 1 Mohawk Dr Londonderry, NH at the corner, then go inside and wait. They fill my order and put it on the pick up tray and every time throw away my receipts. They never offer you a receipt and when I asked for mine today, the associate snapped at me. I threw it out. So I said I needed it and she dug through the trash and threw a receipt that wasn't even mine, that was filthy dirty on the serving tray where they leave the pick up food. As most business owners you write things off on your taxes.I asked to speak to the manager and she approached the manager and said I was being an a--hole. The manager said we always throw them away, it's normal practice and I informed her that was not the right way to do business. I informed her I would reach out to the corporate office about the attitude they both had with me and she said go ahead. So I will do so.It is essential to provide customers with a receipt or proof of purchase, so they are able to show evidence of the purchase when seeking a business tax write off, refund, repair, or replacement.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Went to DD Fosse Park Leicester we were the only ones at the counter but had to wait 10 mins to be served it was being ran by 3 very miserable women who basically couldn’t care less if you were served or not. Was untidy.,1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"This morning I was hungry, so I got two breakfast hashbrown wraps with no egg but insted of that I was given the Great Depression in a wrap their was NO hashbrowns and one of my wraps only had one damn slice of backon that tasted like the definition of charcoal needless to say I'm not impressed and belive that a pile of rocks could have done better now I'll have to spend the rest of my life with this traumatic experense. I fear my stomach will never forgive me.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Stale donuts dirty locations you can also tell that their donuts are refrigerated. Employees don't even smile,1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Went in there this morning, the redhead lady that works there. I guess she's the manager. She's not very nice. She doesn't greet people. She has a mean look on her face and her Customer Service is a -10 out of 10. I will never go to this Dunkin' Donuts again ever.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
A worker named Jesica is very disrespectful and she threatened my son.,1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"This Dunkin’ sucks, they close their oven way too early. It’s incredibly bothersome. I think they should extend their hours if they wanna make more profit.",1,restaurant,Dunkindonuts

I downloaded the app then placed an order for a large pizza looking at checkout for a promo code option but for some reason it was on the home screen at the bottom. Then after all this I order it at 7 40 pm UAE  time it arrives at 10 pm. While I am waiting for the pizza a 15 day valid code pops up expired in June and it is September. I call customer service twice at 8 40 pm after waiting an hour after I ordered the place is 5 minutes on maps BTW. They had said it was cancelled I went to bed and a random number is calling me with the pizza at 10 04 pm. I tried explaining to him but we were confused as each other his timeline was 15 minutes. In the end we got cold pizza. Horrible papa John's,1,restaurant,Papajohns

"I worked for a Papa John’s franchise in Sumqayit, Azerbaijan, and I was forced to leave due to unethical and illegal treatment of employees.My contract location was changed without consent, paid leave was not granted, and employment agreements were handled verbally without documentation. The number of documented employees differs significantly from the actual workforce.These practices violate the Labor Code of Azerbaijan and international labor standards.I have submitted a formal complaint to local authorities and attempted to contact Papa John’s International privately, but there has been no response yet.I am sharing this publicly in hopes that the company will take responsibility and enforce proper compliance from its franchisees.",1,restaurant,Papajohns

Would give a 0 if I could. This pizza has to be the worst pizza I have ever had. Ordered the Shaq-A-Roni pizza. Their picture shows alot of pepperoni on it and cheese. Mine came with less than half of their photo and almost no cheese. Worst pizza I have ever had. They do not give you like the photo. Not even half.,1,restaurant,Papajohns
"I placed an order May 21, 2025 @ 2:09PM at the Papa Johns located at2430 S Interstate 35 E. Denton, TX 76205. I arrived at the location to see a young lady preparing pizza's. I stood there in SHOCK she was using her bare hands (NO GLOVES) picking up different ingredients and putting them on the pizza. Once I got her attention to get my pizza she brought it to me and went to the back behind a door and then came out with her phone in her right hand texting then she continued to pick up ingredients again and place them on the pizza she was preparing. I called her over to the counter and I asked her about wearing gloves...""So you don't wear gloves while preparing pizza?"" Nonchalant she just stood there. I politely said "" I Do Not Want This Pizza Just Refund Me. Thank you.. JUST NASTY.. Moving Forward I'm reminded to just PREPARE My OWN FOOD. I can't begin to tell you how disgusted I am just thinking about it.",1,restaurant,Papajohns
"They told US 15 minutes for the pizzas, we waited more than 1 our and half and the shop was empty, never again",1,restaurant,Papajohns

Did not receive what I ordered. Ordered extra large All The Meats pizza with Spicy Italian Sausage and onions added to it and had it delivered. I didn't receive an All The Meats that I ordered but ended up receiving a cheese pizza with a few pieces of regular Sausage and some onions on it and no other Meats. VERY disappointed.,1,restaurant,Papajohns
I have watched the Latest Papa Johns TV Commercial several times and was NOT Impressed With The Scraggly Looking Crew on the job in that advertisement.... It makes me wonder about the people that are preparing the Pizza for my Family and Friends at Papa Johns ? NOT GOOD.....,1,restaurant,Papajohns
Waited over hour and 20 min for my pizza ran the store 3 times and the person in charge cut me off put the phone down and wouldn’t answer again so I made a complaint to papa johns twice guess what no email of any kind mount of money your paying for papa johns now they should be emailing or ringing us just want to take your money so keep away rude expensive and no help at all,1,restaurant,Papajohns
"On 12/31/2024 we ordered food online through store 2684. We received another customer's order instead. We attempted to call the store, but they would not answer the phone. We contacted customer service online, who also was unable to contact the store. Customer service then stated they would send a gift card to us as a refund. They did not and have since denied they agreed to do so. I guess Shaq decided he need an extra $43.067",1,restaurant,Papajohns
"Called the store to ask for half pepperoni half back on  and the guys said no . Because it was a n uber order he also hung up on me it was the eglington and confereration store . Then they sent me an open 2 l bottle of pop in the bag with a puddle the dips were swimming in it , the pizza was horrible, cold , barely any toppings , hardly any cheese . Cardboard! Never order from them . Garbage. Nasty I am not joking!",1,restaurant,Papajohns
"I wish I could give zero stars. I was halfway through my meal when I noticed a long strand of hair wrapped around my fork — not just near the food, but tangled in it. Completely unacceptable.This wasn’t a minor slip-up. It shows a serious lack of attention to hygiene and food safety. I flagged it to the staff, and the response was underwhelming — no real apology, no urgency, just a weak offer to replace the meal. As if I’d want a second helping after that.I won’t be coming back. If you care about cleanliness and basic standards, think twice before eating here.South Plainfield NJ",1,restaurant,Chipotle
"Chipotle Mexican Grill Tottenham Court Road.The food arrived in a disgusting condition. It was cold, soggy and hadn't been packed correctly so one food had contaminated another, meaning food allergies could have been compromised.

There’s not a garbage restaurant chain as this. Never a good experience.,1,restaurant,Chipotle
Chipotle is not the same any more.  The bowls and burritos always come sloppy.  The amount of protein they add is inconsistent.  I also hate how you can literally lean over the seperation glass.  Every customer is breathing on the food.,1,restaurant,Chipotle
"Chipotle at 1736 N Federal Hwy in Fort Lauderdale Fl has a defective women's toilet that has not been fixed in two years since first being told about the problem. The seat was only connected on one side and it slide and was dangerous. Two years ago a manager said it would be fixed and IT IS STILL NOT FIXED. As a matter of fact, there is NO TOILET SEAT anymore for the last month or more. This is not a slum area, why are you treating your customers like it is a slum? Why is your staff so incompetent? It does not take a rocket scientist to fasten a new toilet seat to a tank. SERIOUSLY. You are a derelict company and if you can't keep a toilet working well, I can only imagine the vermin in your food. DISGUSTING.",1,restaurant,Chipotle
"Terrible experience. Ordered through the app, after 50 minutes the restaurant told the driver to cancel because they were “closing soon.”No real customer support, only a useless bot. Paid with credit card + points and never got a refund. Very disappointing and sadly, Chipotle has been going downhill lately even in their restaurants, not just with delivery.",1,restaurant,Chipotle
"A new low even for Chipotle...Years ago Chipotle used to be our go to for fast, delicious, healthy food for a fair price.Today we barely go to Chipotle anymore.  Our recent visits in many locations all over the U.S. have been disappointing and in result more infrequent.  Prices keep going up, protein portions keep going down.  My visit to the Brownsburg, IN Chipotle is my last visit to Chipotle.Protein portions have gone from fair, to miniscule, to you should be happy with ""essence of protein... because there is none"".  When I protested, I was told that was the normal portion size and I should order chicken instead of steak.  But...I don't want chicken, I want steak.I left.Two more coworkers pulled into the Chipotle parking lot and left after I described my experience.Congrats, Chipotle.  You lost another 30 customers.It's not going to get better.Chipotle's CEO: “Much of what we’re experiencing right now is due to macro and the consumer. The low-income consumer is looking for value as a price point at present,” Boatwright stated. ""Not True.  Everyone wants to get what they paid for.",1,restaurant,Chipotle
"Chipotle was actually pretty good when it started out; we had it about 25 years ago in Tucson. In recent years (maybe the past 10) it has just gotten worse and worse. What gets me the most is the consistent lack of cleaning and maintenance in the dining area. Garbage, food residue and no forks! I have lots of other gripes, but it is clear that the owners don't care enough to change, so I won't waste my effort typing a useful critique",1,restaurant,Chipotle
Not the first time we've gotten brown gross guac. Last time it happened it actually smelled spoiled.,1,restaurant,Chipotle
"i am really disappointed in the fact that i ordered a chicken bowl with white rice, corn and black beans and i got home and couldn't enjoy it. what did they do pour a box of black pepper in it because it was to HOT to eat/ i understand mexican grill but the cook need to lighten up on the spicy seasoning",1,restaurant,Chipotle
"My friend raves about Chipotle in Buckeye AZ and when I went with him in 2023 it was good, portions were fair, price was a bit high. Fall of 2024 I ordered a carne meal online to go. What happened!?! The ""carne"" was all grizzle and fat and looked and tasted like it had been scraped off the bottom of a burnt pan. There was barely a tablespoon, not that I would have wanted more of this disgusting muck. I ordered guacamole and if there was any, I didn't find it. The entire order looked and tasted like it was the leftovers they were getting rid of prior to starting fresh supper orders. I wouldn't give the ""carne"" to my dog. Not worth half the price they charged.",1,restaurant,Chipotle
They gave me no chicken at all and I DoorDash it and it came two hours late,1,restaurant,Chipotle
The portion are tiny. Filled up scoop then dumped half of it off then put on burrito. I paid 52 bucks for 20 dollars worth of food. This is pathetic. Never will i ever go to chipotles again.,1,restaurant,Chipotle
"There is strong reason to believe that the food was either contaminated, improperly handled, or unsafe for human consumption. This has raised significant concerns for my safety and the public health of other consumers.Let this review serve as a formal public notice that I intend to:•	File official complaints with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), U.S. Department of Justice Consumer Protection Branch, FDA, FTC, and local Health Department.•	Pursue civil proceedings against Chipotle Mexican Grill for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other damages.•	Demand a formal investigation and appropriate settlement from Chipotle Corporate to address the harm caused.•	Alert other consumers to the risk of serious illness that may result from dining at this location.I strongly urge anyone reading this to exercise caution and report any health issues immediately if they experience something similar. Food safety should never be compromised, and I will not remain silent about this dangerous and unacceptable situation.I am prepared to escalate this to the fullest extent permitted by law.",1,restaurant,Chipotle
My experience was terrible.You should of been there to watch it unfold.for one thing there were rats running around.They did not give me chips. 🤮They are mean.The jannace girl just ASSUMED that my sister was getting food there.Ya jannace.you need to be fired.I am NEVER coming back.get out💩,1,restaurant,Chipotle
"""Large"" pizza measured 24cm diameter ... that's 36% smaller in area (ie, the actual amount of pizza you get) than a standard 30cm pizza. This surely makes their pizzas the most expensive on the market.  When I complained, they offered me a ""free"" pizza ... but I could only get the ""free"" delivered pizza by spending a minimum of another $21.90. Dominos seem to have forgotten that the main requirement from selling a pizza is the actual pizza.",1,restaurant,Dominos

"Extremely Disappointed - Quality Has Completely DeclinedI’ve been a loyal Domino’s customer for years, but my recent order from the Stony Stratford location was absolutely unacceptable.My wife ordered a pepperoni pizza that arrived covered in a foul-smelling red grease. This greasy substance had completely soaked through the entire pizza and even penetrated the cardboard box underneath. The dough was completely different from what we’ve had before - it was unpleasantly crumbly, broke apart easily, and appeared undercooked. The excessive amount of grease and strange reddish coating around the edges made the pizza completely inedible. We had to throw it away.The Margarita pizza was equally disappointing. It looked almost completely white, as if it had never been properly baked, with the same poor quality dough as the pepperoni.Domino’s used to be my favorite pizza chain, but this experience was shocking. The quality control at this franchise location needs serious attention - this kind of product damages the entire Domino’s brand reputation.As a regular customer, I’m extremely disappointed and expect better.TITSIAN",1,restaurant,Dominos
"Food arrived cold. 30 Min late. And they refused to replace it. Garbage. Paying for cold food. I would order from anywhere else, with Dominos you risk cold food without any recourse.",1,restaurant,Dominos
"On November 17th, my order for 33 euros was not delivered. Today is December 10th. I have not received a refund.",1,restaurant,Dominos
"The quality of Domino's Pizza is pathetic.  Their 10"" BBQ Chicken pizza is abysmal.  I paid twice as much ($15) for that pizza at the local franchise at Medicine Hat Alberta, than I would have paid for a larger pizza out of a freezer out of my local Walmart, and the quality of the Walmart pizza is at least twice as good as Domino's.There was hardly any chicken on a pizza their menu promised would be ""fully loaded"" with chicken.  There was barely enough cheese, making it feel like I was eating nothing but pizza dough with a miniscule amount of toppings, and the dough had the feeling I was eating cardboard.",1,restaurant,Dominos
You have moved and didn’t even update  Google mapsWhen we rang the staff were very unhelpful and couldn’t offer us any directions. We eventually found the place after 45 minutes of driving up and down. Our pizza’s were cold and the when we spoke to the staff they couldn’t care less. Do not eat or order anything from here as we won’t be returning!,1,restaurant,Dominos
"Driver almost got to my location and then turned back to the store. 45 minutes later, the store explained that ""some items in the order were not available and that is why driver returned"". Then order was cancelled. Are these people on crack? If the order was incomplete, it should have never left the store. Also - charge for the order is instantaneous, but refund is 2-5 days? Why?",1,restaurant,Dominos
"Good luck getting hold of an actual person to get a VAT receipt, have been asking for one for the last 4 weeks and every time they say they have passed it on to the franchise who will provide it, but I haven't heard anything back, so I can't claim any money back. Shocking service and will not be going here for team lunches anymore!",1,restaurant,Dominos
"It took over an hour to get our food and it was cold. I called the store and the manager said I could give him all the food back and they would remake it. Isn't that crazy? I didn't want to wait another hour so I said I have a toaster oven, but I shouldn't have to use it for this. I asked for some kind of discount for my hassle, like return the delivery fee, and he hung up on me. I called back for his name and he hung up on me again, slammed the phone down even. I will never buy from any Domino's again in my life. What kind of people run these places??",1,restaurant,Dominos

"Pizza,is terrible,they forgot to put tomato sauce and the cheese is so thin and burnt instead of golden brown,its not the first time. So after many tries,I will no longer order dominos,its just not worth for the price. Bye dominos.",1,restaurant,Dominos
"Really disappointed with Domino’s lately. The quality has become pathetic —no taste, poor texture, and not worth the price anymore. Domino’s used to be my favorite, but not anymore. The meatballs were cut into halves, overly salty, and tasted pathetic. No freshness, no flavor just a waste of money. Domino’s really needs to improve, not worth ordering anymore.",1,restaurant,Dominos
"Order sat for 40 minutes until I called. They told me it would be another 45 minutes to an hour for it to be delivered. Why would they cook the pizza knowing it would sit that long?? I cancelled the order and anyone with a luck of common sense will stop ordering from the Greenville, MS location.  It has been years now since they have had decent customer service.  They really do not care.",1,restaurant,Dominos
It's so irritating how lazy a manager can be. when I specifically ask if I can get my chicken sandwich fresh and that I will wait the time that is needed to get my chicken sandwich fresh but she gives me some what fresh frys and not a fresh chicken sandwich Like I specifically had ask for but instead makes Me wait cause she wanted to pretend like she was just wait for the chicken. This old mf sandwich is so old I can't even bite into it. I seriously hope she gets fired I've worked at fast food before and it never was a inconvenience if a paying customer wanted something fresh.

My Husband raved about the chicken sandwich that he ordered from the BK location in Ypsilanti, MI (located on Michigan Ave); and opted to introduce me to the taste bud experience. The first experience was in deed amazing! The next two times I desired a chicken sandwich he made the grave mistake of going to the Ann Arbor location. The first time I thought was a fluke; but the second has assured me that it is simply their method of operation! My Husband ordered a FRESH chicken sandwich (2 for $5 to be exact)...he was even able to go inside to assure that the order was made fresh.

I went inside to sit down and enjoy my meal, and an employee told me I “wasn’t welcome” because they were having a meeting inside. If the dining area is going to be used for employee meetings, they shouldn’t open the store to the public at that time. The dining room is meant for customers, not as a breakroom or meeting space.It was frustrating and honestly disrespectful. They should have a back room or another area for staff meetings instead of turning customers away. Because of this experience, I won’t be returning to this Taco Bell again.",1,restaurant,Tacobell

We ordered a mexican pizza which requires a fork to eat it. When my husband went to the counter to get our order we were told someone had ran to Pizza Hut which is right down the road to get some forks. So we are sitting at our booth thinking well probably would be back any minute and we would go ahead and eat the tacos while waiting. Ate the tacos and sitting there waiting until I finally went to the counter and asked about the forks. I was told he was not back. Pizza Hut is right down the road. I could have been down there twice and been back. I asked why did you fix our food knowing we had nothing to eat it with and it was sitting there getting cold. No answer so I asked for a bag to put them in so we could go home to see how they would warm up in microwave. Needless to say was not the best.

Unfortunately, once again, my food was cold.

Wow-I went to the chick-fil-a in Greendale Wisconsin with my 10 year old son. The food was great. The atmosphere in food area is a loud and it’s an extension of a casino they had 2 sets of craps (playing dice) going on. A supervisor name Corrie was doing an interview with an applicant. The interview ended at 4:15pm and he looked at one table shooting dice and he just walked directly by them. These kids have made this into a hangout slash casino. I will not be returning someone should police this foolery before it gets more out of control. I informed Malik who notified manager. Malik asked me what supervisor saw this. I informed him Corrie. I then observed Malik go tell a black male this information. The black male just continued to pack orders. Review the CCTV footage for confirmation.

When I called, I was told the only option was to return immediately for a refund, even though the restaurant was close to closing. When I asked for a manager, I was hung up on. After driving back and wasting more of my time, all I was given was a simple refund — no apology, no accountability, and no concern for food safety.This experience shows a complete lack of customer care and hygiene standards.

Then the lady wouldn't take it back because its their policy that you have to keep it in your car once they hand anything to you. What about my policy that you don't hand me something nasty and then refuse to take it back.Chik-Fil-A used to be the best in customer service, now they are literally rock bottom, worst in class. By the way, the nasty NOT food you handed me is on the ground in your parking lot. Enjoy.",1,restaurant,Chick Fil A
First your chicken sandwiches are so salty now they are inedible. And if someone were to order a strawberry milkshake they might expect to have strawberry flavoring whether it be real strawberry or some sort of artificial strawberry. What I received was a cup  of sickly sweet white glop with what I'm guessing was an extremely unpleasant artificial vanilla flavor.To many other fast food places to waste my time with Chick-fil-a,1,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I was let down by the customer service at the Chick-fil-A location in Mira Mesa, San Diego, CA 92126. On several occasions, my orders were incorrect. I reached out to the manager, Taylor, who acknowledged the oversight and offered me a reward of 12 chicken nuggets. When I returned days later to redeem my reward, I ordered a large fries, a spicy chicken sandwich, and a large strawberry lemonade. However, when I got to the window, the young man scanned my reward but charged me $26. I knew this was incorrect, as the total should have been around $16. When I pointed this out, he began to argue with me. I refused to engage in a dispute, and Taylor came over to assist. She asked me to come inside for clarification. Once inside, she handed me the 12 chicken nuggets. It seems Taylor needs to improve her leadership skills; instead of apologizing for her employees' mistakes and the overcharge, she displayed an attitude. This was an unfortunate experience at Chick-fil-A, unlike any I have encountered elsewhere. I hope both the owner and customers take note of the issues at this location.",1,restaurant,Chick Fil A
Don’t get the hype! It’s cheap crap that costs an absolute fortune! Grilled cheese sandwich is a seeded brioche bap with plastic cheese melted! Awful,1,restaurant,Fiveguys
"My first and last visit at this overpriced, low quality, ignorant fast food restaurant. Did not get what I ordered only burger (tasteless) and some leaves of salat, asked for pickles and roasted onions, non was in the burger. Now I know, why the Intu 5 Guys in Derby was not that busy. Paying £ 36 for two burger and two soft drink and having a substandard meal? I regret the visit. Did not bother to complain to the staff, in the long run, lost my business. One time never again.",1,restaurant,Fiveguys

"I ordered through uber eats, the order was being prepared at the Walton Five guys. The order took ages and I gave the benefit of the doubt as it is Friday night. Eventually the order arrived and all the drinks were missing. Then when we opened the food it was freezing cold. I live ten minutes from the restaurant. I find it unacceptable that Five guys gives such poor Service, when it’s not cheap. It can’t be that difficult to read an order and make sure all items are there before it leaves the restaurant. We have used five guys a few times but this was the last straw. They will not be seeing another penny from me and my family. Treating customers this way will only end one way.",1,restaurant,Fiveguys
Not just a bad service but also when you write to the complain t department they back their own bad staff so I won’t be recommending not using this takeaway,1,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Serious Food Safety Warning for Five GuysCustomersOn October 25, 2024, I visited Five Guys and experienced a horrifying incident. After eating part of my burger, I noticed an overpowering smell of toilet/ urinal cleaning chemicals, a mouthful of hair, and dirt.Immediately, my mouth began dissolving, and I became sick.I got a refund employee's were laughing at me & l called the police, subsequent investigation revealed that an employee used my food to clean the drain in the back kitchen in the floor sink and then returned to serve it.Video footage confirmed these unsanitary actions. Despite this, Five Guys and their insurance team have refused to take responsibility and have withheld full footage, sharing only incomplete, edited clips.",1,restaurant,Fiveguys

Five guys is utterly a joke. I just went there to the chiswick London restaurant with a gift card I got for a birthday gift. I went into order. I order the food and gave them my gift card and they couldn’t accept due to the two workers can’t figure out how to pay with my card. Then they said there was nothing on my card to call the number in the card. I will never order from five guys again.,1,restaurant,Fiveguys

"Went to the five guys in Idaho falls with a big appetite expecting a big load of fries but this time I was very disappointed. I usually love five guys but lately they are skipping out on the generosity with the fries. My meal cost $30 for 2 cheeseburgers, 1 regular drink, and one regular fries, normally a regular is enough to feed 2 people, it's more like an extra large but this time a regular is like an extra small. What a waist of money and time let's face it, the generous size if fries is the reason why people come here.",1,restaurant,Fiveguys

Wish I would have read the reviews before I went. My First time. Yonge & Sheppard local. Burger was thin dry and tasted like sawdust. Toppings were meagre fries were all broken in pieces... all for $18.51. Won't EVER be back. This isn't junk food. It's pure highway robbery and garbage. In fact they took down their Google review page... Gee I wonder why.,1,restaurant,Fiveguys

My husband called from his phone also repeatedly and when someone picked up they cursed at him!!!!The rudest and most arrogant employees ever. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!They will incorrectly give you an order if you do drive through. (I'm thinking because they are cashing in on your money without giving you what you ordered. If you try to call they will not answer and finally if someone does they will curse at you and hang up.  I have even use different cell numbers and politely asked to speak to a manager and the person who answers tells me NO in an authoritative voice and hangs up.

We thought the screen was not working waited for another screen placed the order again and the same happened again. Turns out when they don’t  have an item it doesn’t tell you they don’t have it, just come up error once you’ve got all the way to the end and tried to pay. When asked at the counter why they didn’t just remove it or blank it out on the screens instead of the customer spending all that time placing the order and it not going threw they said they can’t. What a rubbish system and yet again a waste of our time. Know wonder they’re going skint in America.",1,restaurant,Wendys

Because of that, the burger got totally spoiled, and even my fries were completely soaked. You can clearly see in the image that everything was messy and wet, and we had to put the spoiled items into a separate dirty container.I called the delivery boy, but he did not speak to me properly. When I insisted, he first said that he received the order from the restaurant in that condition. But later, he accidentally admitted that the order had slipped from his hands. Also, the restaurant’s packaging was not proper.",1,restaurant,Wendys

"I had one of the worst fast food experiences ever at this Wendy’s location. I placed and paid for my order through the official Wendy’s app. When I arrived, they told me my order was an “old order” and just flat-out refused to prepare it. No explanation, no apology, no effort to make it right — just a dismissive attitude.To make things worse, the phone number listed in the app didn’t work, so I had no way to reach out to anyone for help or support. The staff offered zero assistance, and I essentially paid for food I never received.This is unacceptable. If your location accepts online orders, then you need to honor them. Period. If not, take the option off the app or get your systems in order. I left frustrated, hungry, and out the money I paid. Completely unprofessional and a total failure in customer service.Avoid this location unless you want to gamble on whether or not you’ll actually get what you paid for.",1,restaurant,Wendys
"They are always slow and never give condiments when I ask.

The Jr. Bacon cheeseburger was awful, the burger was supposed to be made without lettuce, pickles, onions well it wasn't nowhere near that and it was cold. The Dave's double was cold neither one of my son's would eat their sandwiches. They both sandwiches away, the fries were cold and there were hardly any fries in the boxes. For $35 you would think you could at least get some hot fries. Sandwiches shouldn't be cold or hard like bricks. I want my $35 back!!",1,restaurant,Wendys

"I went to the Camden branch with some colleagues. I ordered a chicken burger and fries which was fine, my colleague ordered some chicken tenders and when he bit into one of them it was raw.

I wasn’t going to drive all the way back, instead the next day I tried to contact corporate to try to get half a refund on my order since I did not get what I paid for, they denied half my refund and tried to give me points on my account stating they did not have a way to refund back to my card on file. What kind of a corporate company robs their customers like this!  if you can’t refund on the app you created then why allow clients to use it? I cannot tell you how unbelievably unprofessional this place is. this company has definitely lost my business no matter where I go. I will never eat a Popeyes.",1,restaurant,Popeyes

My receipt indicated I should receive $9.68 in change, she gave me $9.00 She said yes it should have been $9.68 but that she did not have any change. When I got home I found that my dirty, overpriced chicken was not nearly up to Popeye's standards.

Ordered two Cajun Turkeys for Thanksgiving 2025. Got it ordered by the deadline and the delivery date changed twice. It finally delivered the day after Thanksgiving while we were out of town.

"On 11:30:25, I was a customer at Popeyes in Aurora. The service I received was downright outrageous. First, my order was incorrect, and second, when I pointed it out, one of the employees became aggressive. I think this will be my last visit to Popeyes.",1,restaurant,Popeyes
"My local is basingstoke popeyes and from what I've seen it's pretty good. Staff are nothing short of perfection and always are happy to efficiently help with smiles on their faces. My main issue is with the managers. I have heard so many reports of managers at this Popeyes being plain HORRIBLE to their staff not taking into account that these literal children working there go to college full time and have enough stress as it is, they do not need a fully grown adult calling them out and fully shouting after they have given the staff too many tasks, not trained them properly so now it's physically Impossible for the staff to do everything they're asked and it's not their fault. They make children feel horrible about themselves and more and more people want to leave day by day. If you want this location to stay open with good sales get rid of the managers as they are ruining it. I know one of them is called Vicoss and he is one of the main culprits.",1,restaurant,Popeyes

"I don’t usually go out of my way to leave reviews, but Subway has been slipping hard lately. The last couple of visits have honestly made me question why I even bother. The food looks nothing like the ads, the ingredients seem cheaper every time, and the whole experience feels rushed and careless. My sub was barely warm, missing toppings, and the bread tasted like it had been sitting around all day.What really gets me is the lack of customer care. Staff acted like serving people was an interruption, not their job. And don’t get me started on the app — slow, glitchy, and half the time it forgets your login. For a big chain, you’d think they’d have this figured out by now.I’m giving two stars because it used to be decent and every now and then you still get a good sandwich… but at this point, it feels more like luck than consistency.

"My sister and I visited a Panda Express in our town today for the first time.  She had heard a lot about Panda Express and wanted to try it.  Needless to say, I don't think we will be visiting there again.The food was okay, I guess.  But I can't see going there when there are Authentic Chinese restaurants nearby, that serve anything you could want, as far as chinese goes.  And there is a Chinese Buffet almost right across the road from this Panda Express, where you can enjoy all you can eat for roughly the same price.Anyway, I can't see what all the hubub is about with Panda Express.  Like I said, the food was okay, so I wouldn't complain too much about that.  It just doesn't hold up against real Chinese, like the restaurants.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress

"I Went to Panda Express 5410 sliver hill rd Suitland Maryland with my mom to grab lunch around 10:40am and we had to wait for food because employees wasn’t at work yet and the manager was hosting interviews I asked for sweet fire chicken , orange chicken and rice I requested for fresh food because the food quality wasn’t good and the rice was hard my order was messed up it was poor communication with the staff and the employees argued with me about my order telling me she was going by what was written on the box but I was not finishing ordering me being in the military I did not appreciate the disrespect and the service I asked for a manager and all the employees was acting as a manager but couldn’t fix the problem I was not satisfied at all",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress

After multiple emails back and forth, the Panda team did some research and sent me a coupon, valued at more than $8. So, the issue is settled now. I'm also changing my rating from 1 to 2 (not going above this because most likely their software continues to have the same defect).",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I live in Anderson Indiana and me and my son really enjoy pansa express, one of my favorites is sweetfire chicken, but for a few months now I haven't been able to have it because the pieces of breaded chicken are too hard to eat.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I have visited Panda Express many times but the last few times i visited they are giving more and more smaller and less portions. But yet the price remain the same. Is this shrinkage? Is this become like other restaurants ie: McDonalds, Burger King. Where people have to stop supporting them in order for them to stop giving less for more. I am becoming very dissatisfied in this reoccurring problem. This has  happen in Florida and many many times at the Panda Express store #2909. In visiting this Panda Express I have heard other in line complain about the same thing. PLease change your standards and portion size.M. Goins",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"When I got home and opened my order, needless to say, it was not correct.  It would’ve been a waste of time to get in my car and drive all the way back across town to get the order corrected. This was just a recently opened panda express Asked for Chow Main and got fried rice.  The fried rice was salty and lacking in flavor and definitely not fried.  I have had fried rice before, and there’s definitely no comparison.  The chicken in the mushroom chicken looked weird and didn’t taste like chicken. The only good thing about the order was the orange chicken. That was not spicy like it said it was still good. Could not get any better than two stars.  Needless to say, I won’t be eating there again.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Now Panda Express has its ups and its downs. Like for example their Orange Chicken is amazing, but on the inside it is filled with chicken fat. Everyday I hope that there is no fat in the chicken.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"We eat here often and are almost always satisfied. Today we ordered two big plates and received approximately half the portions of all four items that we typically receive. The food appeared old, shriveled, and made me feel as though they had served us the last bit of dried sticky leftovers. Very disappointed. There are too many other options in Sherman Texas to receive this crap.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Employees are the worst, they assume you know all that comes in a plate and get angry if you ask.  I like the food,  but since in all locations seems to be the norm, I won't come back, doesn't worth to see angry people giving me food. Plus,  they don't bring the card terminal to the drive thru,  just take your card and disappear.  Expensive for fast food as well.  $8.20 for a rice bowl.",2,restaurant,Pandaexpress

Back when I was a kid, going there with my parents always felt like a celebration. 😊 But recently, after nearly five years away, I decided to stop by on my own—and I couldn’t believe my eyes.

It’s really disappointing to see things take such a turn for the worse.",2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts

This was truly a frustrating experience, and I hope Dunkin’ takes steps to improve.",2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
I ordered a sesame bagel with olive oil spread on the side and got a plain bagel with spread oozing out the sides and it slathered everywhere. Disappointed!,2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
I worked at Dunkins growing up and religiously drank Dunkin coffee. However from my generation to current times Dunkin Donuts changed too much with their donuts and bagels. We used to use dough and fry the donuts and bagels at the store. Now they come in boxes frozen. Even after there freshly baked it is awful. Dunkin franchise operators from bengal who don't even keep fresh coffee and using thermostat closed hot coffee machines which create steam coffee staying on shelf for 2 hours when it should only be for 45 minutes.,2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Don't visit this unless you want a donut and a basic hot drink. No other hot food at all. This bears no resemblance to the US where you get breakfasts and all kinds of lovely hot snacks. This is a brand new large drive thru and seems a massive opportunity wasted.,2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts

It's freezing in there and music was horrible and so loud. You couldn't think straight. We took ours to go. But never again will we go to that one. Then, we were in the 1 down the street from us and they mop the floor while your eating. Can't they wait until customers traffic slows down? My mom is over 90 and we could sue if she slipped and fell. They have limited sorts of Donuts and Breakfast items. DD has gone to the Dogs.",2,restaurant,Dunkindonuts

"I was a big fan of Papa Johns cuz the flavour of the pizza is what I like. However, recently, when I order it, I found that they dont have the good quality as before, one of my pizza's source was sour and the dough is rough. Also the deliver time is toooooo looooong. I hope you guy will pay attention to that and hope you guys do that well in the future",2,restaurant,Papajohns
I love papa John’s pizzas.  That being said I ordered a pizza from a papa John’s in Springfield Ohio for delivery as I was at work.  Keep in mind I was literally 5 minutes down the road from the papa John’s I ordered from.  I waited almost an hour for my pizza. At least 20 minutes or more after it said it was ready before it was delivered to me.  I wasn’t aware that it was door dash that delivered for them.  Apparently from the many pizza boxes in the back of the delivery drivers vehicle (I watched him sort through them for almost 5 minutes before he brought it in to me) he had waited until he had several orders before delivering to make it better for him and to make more money.  In doing so my pizza was basically cold and disgusting.  So I won’t be ordering papa John’s again. It was a lot of money and I don’t care how they deliver their pizzas because I pay for that service but I want my pizza in a timely manner and hot.  I’ll spend less at other pizza shops anc get my food hot.,2,restaurant,Papajohns

"I'm a Construction Manager and found offering Pizza to the entire crew for lunch is a simple way to get them involved and working well. I've used a variety of places to deliver; Pizza Hut, Little Caesars and Dominos along with Papa Johns. Of the four of them the prices are similar as well as the product. But why is Papa Johns the worst among them with service and delivery. Are the location near me simply overwhelmed? I'll call a day in advance when ordering 10-20+ large pizzas to give them a heads up and be prepared. It's ordered the day before and still late, delivery info isn't given to the drivers who call and say they can't find the place, the worst is they forget plates, napkins and cups, seriously? 20 large pies and 8 pops without any easy way to drink or eat?",2,restaurant,Papajohns
"I gave up on them, awhile ago. They kept, bringing my Pizza burned,and after complaints went unnoticed. I stopped, ordering from them.And they are about 10 minutes away from me but,I refuse to pay for burnt pizza.If they would stop rushing, the orders it would be ok. But I'm done with them.",2,restaurant,Papajohns
"I order from time to time only when I can afford it and only because my children likes their pizza I personally like ""little ceasars""just the same and they are waaaay cheaper!

It is hard to believe going to a restaurant like Chipotle and being told they are out of lettuce at 2:00 pm.  We were also told they were out of Chimiconga sauce even though it was advertised.  This restaurant needed more people working to handle the extremely long line of people waiting to order.  This was the Chipotle off I71 in Ohio in Jeffersonville.,2,restaurant,Chipotle

"I honestly stopped going a year ago after completely giving up on everything there. I got somewhat triggered by reading the recent news that stated that chipotle now “requires” their staff to smile at you. If chipotle’s leadership thinks that’s what’ll fix them then they have no idea how to run a successful business.Your staff needs proper training for consistency and how to serve food. Fix this first before telling them to smile.My family, friends, and I will prob never go to a chipotle again. And it sucks. It used to be so good.",2,restaurant,Chipotle
I spent 30 minutes as a dasher picking up an order.  The lady doing take out was working hard but was overwhelmed.  The way the store is set up she had to run to the front make line 15 times to get products that were either out or not carried at her position.  The assistant manager was having to not only cook but slice meats and deliver to the make lines.  Clearly there is either a set up issue or not enough product is being prepped in advance.  This falls back on management.,2,restaurant,Chipotle

Out of all my online Chipotle orders, there is always a problem with the food. I ordered a chicken burrito and they gave me a whole different kind of burrito which I never asked for. If you order in-store instead, you can guarantee a meal that you are satisfied with.",2,restaurant,Chipotle
"My wife and I went last night for the new brisket bowl and burrito. The meat was so tough, it was nearly inedible. A $13.99 for just a burrito, this was not even close to being worthwhile.",2,restaurant,Chipotle

"I order online a lot because im usually busy with something but every time I do a Chipotle online order they give me half the meat they would if I show up in person and when you go in person it’s not enough meat to begin with. at one point one of my coworkers asked me why would I order a bowl with no meat in it? to which my reply was “I did ordered meat, it had like 5 single squares of chicken“ it’s ridiculous, why even have the app when I have to show up in person anyways to make sure I’m not getting scammed? people pay for it so stop hugging the ingredients. The portions are too small already, it’s a bowl full of rice.",2,restaurant,Chipotle

"I placed my order an hour before the desired delivery time, but the courier was 40 minutes late. The food, of course, arrived cold.

"The online app is horrible. It would not allow for delivery saying I am out of the area. Yet they have delivered here many times. I called the store and they couldn't tell me why the app said I was not in the delivery area. Then I ordered to carry out. This was not convenient for me but I needed to get pizza for my crew. I added the detailed order but I did not enter the order to checkout, yet it went ahead and placed the order. I was waiting to submit the order closer to the time that I needed the pizzas. This is because there was no place to put the time that I requested the order. I even called the store and they had no idea how to choose a custom time to pick up the order.  The food was ready over an hour before I was serving. Not happy.",2,restaurant,Dominos
"Kudos to the staff at our local store. Our previous order had some mistakes, but the crew there 'made it right' so we were happy to order from them again. However, the online ordering system is aggravating with multiple pop-ups urging to add additional things to an order. There was even a duplicate pizza in size large that appeared on the order for the current sale special of two 2-topping pizzas for $6.99 each. Once the extra pop-up item was removed and details on each pizza verified, the order was placed online. The system requires not just a phone number, but also an e-mail to place the order. Once credit card information was entered, the check-out process was fairly smooth. However, the page showing the order number that serves as a receipt only gives details on how many pizzas were ordered and the total paid but no details on WHAT was ordered to go on each pizza! The problem with the previous order that we had was related to having the wrong toppings on the pizzas. It would be really helpful if the receipt page would show details on the pizza being purchased and not just on the quantity and price.",2,restaurant,Dominos
"Inexpensive pizza.  It's the best price in town and that helps but I've had pretty poor cust service at the Hopkinton, MA location.

"I’ve always liked popping into the McDonald’s in South Melbourne — it’s usually one of my favourite spots for a quick feed. But this visit really missed the mark.I asked for a fresh chicken sandwich and even said I was happy to wait, no drama at all. Instead, I got lukewarm fries and a chicken sandwich so old and dry I could hardly bite into it. The manager clearly couldn’t be bothered, acting like she was “waiting on the chicken” while handing over something that had obviously been sitting there for ages.Look, I’m not asking for anything wild — just the fresh food I actually ordered. I’ve worked in fast food myself, and making something fresh was never a hassle, especially when the customer specifically requested it.Pretty disappointing experience overall.

"Dirty restaurant, miserable staff.To say that there was excitement about Taco Bell opening in the north, it's a shame to see how poor the experience is. I imagine that the staff are not paid particularly well, so why should they take pride in what they do. Cleaning, greeting customers and taking care over presentation are lacking.Time for management to take a long look at basic values. High prices for a mediocre experience. Not doing that again.",2,restaurant,Tacobell
i went to taco bell and i got a quesadilla and they didn’t cut it for me there was one peice of steak in each slice i had to CUT and it took them forever for it,2,restaurant,Tacobell
"Well that was disappointing! Had delivery, burrito was the size of a Tesco wrap, the nachos were no more than  what you get in a standard bag of crisps. £10.49 for what was effectively a superstore meal deal.I don’t get the hype.",2,restaurant,Tacobell
My order was short 1Cheese N Chip and 5 Avocado sauces that I paid for. There was so much of the regular sauces threw on the top I didn't check the order before pulling off. I had my baby with me and it took forever to get my order. I tried calling at least 6 times and no one picked up. I shouldn't have to come in just to get the correct order.,2,restaurant,Tacobell
"I ordered the tasty looking kitkat quesadias. On the picture it's full of choclate and three rows of biscuits but when I got it it wasone row if choclate and not so much choclate around it. It was pretty ""dry""./Andreas",2,restaurant,Tacobell
Wife and I eat Soft Shell Toco Supremes frequently. It seems the amount of taco meat is diminishing. Last stop was basically a lettuce and tomato soft shell sandwich. Very little taco meat. Only 2 out of 5 for my review.,2,restaurant,Tacobell
Taco bell is usually good butt this night shift made my taco taste like straight doo doo. And is made my sisters chicken nuggets taste like they were drenched in jalapeños. Would NOT recommend this taco bellThis day 5/25/2025,2,restaurant,Tacobell

The Royal oak michigan location off of 11 mile is ridiculous I don’t understand having an automated system and still being super slow???? Line is constantly in the street which is super dangerous because it’s a super high populated area with the highway Also don’t know why you have an automated system if you have an employee that answers back on it anyway.,2,restaurant,Tacobell

"Ordered from a stand alone store because the store nearest to me doesn't do chicken noodle soup. Had to order using Grub Hub. Got no condiments,  cutlery,  napkins or receipt. Called the store and they stated because I didnt use the app they don't give receipts. So not only did I not recieve anything to eat my food with I lost out on my points on a $80.00 order. This was at the 90 MacCorkle Ave store in South Charleston WV. Never had a problem with Chick-fil-A until today all because the store nearest me is in a Mall and don't do Chicken Noodle Soup.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A

"I’m writing to express my disappointment with the experience I had at the 1185 Woodstock Rd, Roswell, GA 30075 chick fil a restaurant on July 12th, around 4:45 PM.As a longtime customer who has always appreciated the food and service, I was surprised and frustrated by what occurred. The restaurant was nearly empty, and I was standing by the mobile order/catering pickup area while six employees stood nearby, seemingly unoccupied. Despite making eye contact and waiting patiently for several minutes, no one acknowledged me.After about three minutes, I was left with no choice but to raise my voice and ask, “Can someone come over here and help me?”—which I regret having to do, as it’s not how I like to communicate. The lack of attention and basic courtesy was both disappointing and out of character for your team, based on all my previous visits.I hope this feedback helps reinforce the importance of attentiveness and professionalism, even during slower hours. I look forward to returning soon and seeing the level of service I’ve always come to expect.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
Chick Fil A on Jog and Lantana in Lake Worth Florida should not be charging 10$ for 4 chicken tender entree alone on doordash. That is way too OP even for rich people. And ya'll doin this by the hood. Keeping the poor people poor. Shame!,2,restaurant,Chick Fil A

"Was treated extremely poorly by management staff over the phone right after I placed my order and also corporate the same day. Do not understand why management feels now that they can just beat the people any kind of way especially when they’re spending a lot of money for lunch. Another sign that is time to stop giving, my harder money to fast food restaurants and maybe just start doing stuff for my own. With all pissed off customers it seems on here now the more people stop eating at fast food restaurants, and affecting their profits the more they’ll see that it is us who keep them in business and will not tolerate disrespect. I have made up my mind no more fast food restaurants.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Chick Fil A is a restaurant that continues to pride itself in it's customer service and excellent food variety. Unfortunately due to inflation, the food prices have gone up and the portion sizes have DECREASED! This means you need to order more food/chicken sandwiches, just to get a meals worth.  It's bad enough that Chick Fil A is still anti LGBTQ  (Yet they still want their money) but but now they want to serve BURGERS? I have no idea what Chick Fil A even is or stands for anymore. Saying that I have been disappointed in them for over the past two years, is an understatement.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A

"Went to chik-fil-a harlem nyc and ordered two salads,medium fries and two lemonade and a cheese sauce. When I got home I had one salad no fries.  I immediately contact the store and could not speak to anyone so I lefted a voice message. No.one contacted me and when I did go back to the store I was told by the manager that there was nothing she could do for me. Make sure you check your bag before you leave the store.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
I waited over 20 minutes for a medium waffle fries and the fries wasn’t hot. The guy who supposed to be serving the food for the customers all he did was called out my name and expected me to come to him pick up my order. I dined in by the way. He looked like he had a bad attitude towards doing your job. This is located in Coral Springs Fl. I won’t go to this location anymore.,2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"The chicken tortilla soup is no longer chicken tortilla soup. Paying over $8 for a bowl of this saddens me. White beans don’t belong in tortilla soup, but even so, the flavor was not what it should have been , besides being very thick like a chili.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Worked there for a bit a few years ago and it was fine then. The most recent time though, it seems the quality has dropped. The nuggets are still good, but that's really the only thing on the menu I like anymore.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Since I first posted this review on July 22, 2022 I was phoned by the Chick-Fil-A location twice, I returned both phone calls and left messages to the people that had placed the phone call.To date I have not received any other calls nor have they reached out to me by email, having my email contact information. How eager are they to resolve my bad experience?"" I recently visited the Plattsburgh, NY location of Chick-Fil-A for lunch. I ordered a spicy chicken combo and asked the girl behind the counter if the chicken was crispy as I had mentioned that previously it wasn't.Upon biting into the sandwich I was convinced  things haven't changed the sandwich was neither crispy nor was it spicy. Being hungry I finished it only to be convinced that if I want crispy I go to Popeye or KFC, if I want soggy and non spicy Chick-Fil-A is my go too, sad but Goodbye Chick-Fil-A.""I have moved on a little disappointed but moved on.",2,restaurant,Chick Fil A

"My recent visit to the new Five Guys location in Uppsala was a disappointing experience, particularly given the restaurant's reputation and premium pricing.Pricing & ValueThe cost was a major drawback, with the meal being approximately 50% more expensive than what one would typically pay for a standard lunch in the area. This steep price point does not align with the quality of the food or the service received, representing poor value for money.Food Quality & AccuracyThe meal itself was unfortunately sub-par. Not only was the order incorrect, but the food quality was also very poor. The soda had almost no carbonation, and the burger was soggy and lacked any flavor. The burger was so saturated that it left a residue on my hands that was difficult to wash off, making it impossible to use a touchscreen device afterward.ConclusionWhile I had hoped for a quality meal, the combination of high prices, an incorrect order, and a soggy, tasteless burger made for a negative experience. It's a review that highlights significant issues with both the product and the service at this location.",2,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Good burger, little boring, no searing on the burger which gives a better taste but the fries were over salted and half of them were over cooked. Gave me a stomach ache.",2,restaurant,Fiveguys
Went  to store 1900 tamaimi trail port Charlotte Florida...order was all wrong1burger said pickels lettuce and Mayo got tomatoes and no mayo..2nd burger order bacon and paid for bacon guess what!!!!

Went to five guys in Neümünster in Germany- cold burgers and no ice for the soda. So warm drinks and cold burgers.. the staff was just like whatever.. we may not come again,2,restaurant,Fiveguys

"Five Guys Nottingham Market SquareThe way the product was served was gross: the hot dog and burger were wrapped in silver foil making them soggy. They were then placed into a flimsy paper bag and a mountain of fries was dropped on top of them. When I opened the bag, half of the fries fell onto the dirty table and were thus inedible. Why can't they simply use a tray?The hot dog was average and my friend said their burger was also average. The fries were truly terrible: greasy, burnt and yet somehow devoid of flavour. They literally tasted of nothing, not even potato. We left most of the 50% that weren't already wasted.Order also took 15 minutes to prep and it ends up being expensive - a full meal with drink is nudging £15 per person",2,restaurant,Fiveguys
"I like the food.Pricing here in Naples has gotten out of control > $20 for a sandwich, fries and a soda.I can go to a sports bar or an entertainment place and pay $16 for same meal.  Won’t be back til prices are down to $16 for meal.",2,restaurant,Fiveguys
First and last time eating from this establishment.   Was not impressed at all.   Burger was dry and fell apart while eating it.    I've better burgers at half the price at dive bars.   Prices are ridiculous.  The only decent thing was the fries.,2,restaurant,Fiveguys
Very disappointed with the size of the cheeseburger 😞; the meat had no taste and the bread was cold.,2,restaurant,Fiveguys
love how the food is cooked to order but i ordered delivery and i hate how long it took to get to me the food was code eww,2,restaurant,Fiveguys
Most expensive fast food out there and you would expect quality to match. Yuck. I opened my burger and bun was so soggy the entire sandwich fell apart. Taste besides was bland. Fries are very salty and average in taste. Don't plan on going back. I didn't even get a drink and it cost almost twenty bucks.,2,restaurant,Fiveguys
Overpriced burgers that should not cost as much as they do.,2,restaurant,Fiveguys
We ate at a Five Guys in Papillion Nebraska. We were charged for 3 drinks when there were only 2 of us. When my husband told the guy about it he said he didn’t know how to credit it - therefore we did not get reimbursed! That’s a lot of money for the company or someone if that happens often. Most people don’t check their receipts— Check yours!  The burgers were ok but the fries were soggy. First and last time we will eat at a Five Guys.,2,restaurant,Fiveguys

"Our first impression of Wendy's at Mahon Point.Today I tried Wendy's Spicy chicken. It was such a disappointment; it wasn't spicy, with a thin tasteless slice of tomato and only a tiny amount of something tasting like Heinz mayonnaise.When I collected my wife, she refused to buy it and went straight to buy at Hillbilly's restaurant just around the corner from Wendy's.I decided to give Wendy's a second chance and tried the Wendy's Triple with Chili Cheese Fries and a vanilla Frosty.* The hamburger did taste slightly better than McDonald's, but that's not a compliment.* The Chili Cheese Fries were okay; my wife liked them. But I found it too mediocre.* The vanilla Frosty, again, my wife liked it. For me, it tasted like an ordinary sweet milkshake.Both my wife and I agree, it's not a place we will visit again, with better alternatives in Ireland, such as Hillbilly's and Supermac's, and many other places. It's simply overpriced American junk food.",2,restaurant,Wendys
We visited the Whitby branch today and it wasn’t busy.We abandoned our first choice of table because it wasn’t cleaned.Person assembling food was not wearing protective gloves.The burger ( unlike every other Wendy’s I’ve eaten )was tepid rather than hot.The toilet was smelly and in need of a good clean ( especially the sink.,2,restaurant,Wendys

Visited Wendy's in Wisbech today. Hottest day of the year so far and was greeted by a heatwave. Asked the staff why was there no air conditioning and was informed it was broken. The staff were absolutely sweating but really helpful me and my partner felt so sorry for them. 5 stars for the staff but 1 Star for the shop conditions. Won't be going back until air conditioning is fixed. Such a shame.,2,restaurant,Wendys

"Wendy's in Orangeburg sc need training like chick fil a. Don't care how long you wait in Drive thru.....then they would get on the microphone and tell you, it will be 30 mins before they take your order, when there's no car in front of you. Both Wendy's always out of something. They have lost a lot of customers. Everybody is complaining.",2,restaurant,Wendys
"The food was cold and the fries were just bad. I spent over $12 and tossed most of it away. I sat in the drive through for almost 10 minutes alone, no one in front of me. This was at the Plymouth MN store. I knew I should have gone to the Taco Bell next door.",2,restaurant,Wendys
Had high hopes as have heard good things about this. The wait for two burgers and fries and two kids meals took forever. Enjoyed the fact they have jacket potatoes but the burgers were very average and I wouldn’t bother coming again.,2,restaurant,Wendys
"No napkins, no hot sauce, no honey. The chicken was a breast, wing and leg. The leg still had some moisture but the other 2 pieces were like fried Papier-mâché. Dry as dust and obviously old. I have come multiple times because of  the price, but that is fixing to end. Not a good value when the chicken is barely edible.",2,restaurant,Popeyes
"We were missing two fries at the cost of £6.00. The biscuit was hard as a rock, deep fried I think. The chicken was flavourless, very disappointed to say the least. I have eaten Popeyes many times as I lived in the States, this was nothing like it. KFC had mire flavour, sadly to say I will not be back.",2,restaurant,Popeyes
"We ordered a Thanksgiving turkey for pickup, well in advance. Popeyes took it upon themselves to cancel that order due to hitting a snag. No one called us to let us know or anything.

At this point, I will take my business to Zaxbys.",2,restaurant,Popeyes
"Ordered from Dartford store via Uber eats, delivery was quick however, there was no chicken in the delivery.

"My complaint is the quality of the food. my wife and I got 2 orders of chicken tenders to go. What we got was a box of cold hard pieces of breading. If I was eating at the restaurant, I would have gotten a refund. I will not be going back!!",2,restaurant,Popeyes
Staff were friendly. The food however. Double spicy burger straight out of the frier dripping with oil no other flavour. Pickles were just like eating cucumber no vinegar. Mash was ok but gravy was tasteless. And traditional chicken no flavour at all.,2,restaurant,Popeyes
"I did not receive what I had ordered. My order was for only thighs. what I got was 1 tiny meatless wing, one small leg and a breast. The fries were limp. this was Popeyes in Coon Rapids. I will never order from them again. Both times were very disappointing.",2,restaurant,Popeyes
"First impressions were good as a lovely lady helped us order and we can't fault her whatsoever.The food was quick, delivered to our table looking quite fresh and promising.The fries I thought were nice again fresh and hot .Then came the main contender the chicken burger and boneless nuggets 😭.The Burger had a thin slice of chicken engulfed in a greasy tasting batter .The nuggets were like bullets 👎the ones from asda that's been it the oven since 9am are better.I know it's a crunchy batter but the whole grease taste just didn't do it for us.I suppose it's wasn't as expensive as five guys so I don't feel as violated thank god.Will I be going back NO a big fat NO.Ps I only gave a 2 ⭐ because of the lovely lady who helped us. she herself gets a five ⭐The food gets a one ⭐",2,restaurant,Popeyes
"First of all: food was great.Although it was cold by the time we got to it as the wheel literally came off my friend's wheelchair, trying to exit the property.  Even after a discussion about needing a ramp for the single-step entry (and being told they have one), they didn't bring it out for us to exit! Then on attempting the narrow end of the step, the tyre came off the wheel  ... a couple of people tried to help (NOT the staff) ... but I had to rush it down the road to Timpsons and then Decathlon to get it fixed (KUDOS to both of them for helping).  While I was doing that, my friend was stuck on the step, feeling embarrassed and helpless (being looked at and treated like a homeless person).  Twice he made eye contact with the staff, but not only did they not come out to help him inside, but they ignored him and didn't even check he was okay!!  So not only not a wheelchair-friendly entrance, but a COMPLETE LACK OF EMPATHY OR TRAINING OF THE STAFF.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Appalling, actually.",2,restaurant,Popeyes
Popeye chicken should be ban for the high sodium levels in their food. Their food is actually worse than chicken cottage and Morley. I'm feeling the health impacts off just 1 meal. I've eaten 4 or 5 times. It's not about how nice the food is but they need to control the level of salt which impacts the consumers,2,restaurant,Popeyes

"I really wish I could give a better rating because the rare times they've gotten it right, the food is so good. The issue is the massive inconsistency from store to store that you just don't see from other popular fast food places. One Popeyes may have fast service, another may have a 30 minute wait for your food. One might have great delicious chicken, another will have chicken that's dry and not very warm. The inconsistency has caused us to no longer stop there on road trips or other times when fast food would be convenient.",2,restaurant,Popeyes

"I haven't had subway in years but this was disappointing and never something I have experienced before. It was disappointing to discover that technology is taking over the good old days. What is so wrong with the traditional ordering at the counter and choosing what you want at the salad counter watching them make it. The new way of ordering on a screen is confusing and for those who struggle with the use of technology, this is very hard for some to understand. Apart from  this, my meal was enjoyable so I will give you 3 stars. Please bring back traditional ordering to make it more understandable.",3,restaurant,Subway
I love the food and the staff. My problem is the website. It does not allow me to take food from my recent orders and add them to my bag. It doesn't include all of the types of chips available at my local restaurant. Once I have identified my local restaurant it takes me back to a map of the country and requires me to put in my ZIP Code. The chat feature is so directive that it would not allow me to place this comment on subways website. I was continually forced into categories that did not fit.,3,restaurant,Subway
I got the foot long and the 6 inch titan turkey very disappointed with 6 inch they don’t look to see what I on sandwich there was hardly any meat it just looked like a piece of bread with nothing in it what does 2x mean is it just veggies it’s very miss leading to pay over 8 dollars for six inch bread yes I wanted it plain never the less very disappointing servers don’t look what comes on them normally they expect customers to tell them what’s on the sandwich,3,restaurant,Subway
"Subway actually isn’t that bad, it depends where you go to. But there food is alright, although I don’t like how crunchy and old it can be sometimes. There drinks are really good!

Always has plenty of veg's on it, this one had almost none & when I asked the employee, she said this is how they are made everywhere. I know they are not, 2 tomatoes slices on a vegetable sandwich is not normal. Also,  they had no change in the drawer to pay my change. They had to go in the other room & get money. Not very professional.  This store is located in Catskill NY.  I will not go there again. There was a gentlemen there & he was also disappointed in his ham sandwich too.",3,restaurant,Subway
"I get a good sandwich every time I go on but this time I got a churro and it was so bad I had to spit it out, it was definitely undercook but then got home and put in the air fryer it was still gross gross 🤢 so whatever it was $2.00 but I didn't even get a hello or anything when I walked in, I thought that was very rude, at least say hello or acknowledge me!!!",3,restaurant,Subway
"We love pizza from Pizza Hut, including the sides.  They are so tasty, with the right amount of cheese and always hot.  As long as it is not overcooked that is!  This is the Nuneaton branch.We ordered garlic and herb dips, but received garlic & buttermilk, this was the second time this has happened.  These dips are bland and worthless!  We called the branch and was told they do not, or will not have garlic & herb dips anymore, even though they are still available to order on the website!The meal was not the same, and my husband refuses to order from here again.Very disappointing, they should not just presume we want a bland dip!They need to be careful as they are already in administration, which is a shame!",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Was nice, but the pineapple wasn’t very juicy.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I have many fond memories of Pizza Hut growing up as a Child in the late 80's early 90's. The atmosphere inside the Restaurants was Electric and very exciting knowing you where going to get like an amazing feed for your Buck. Pizza Hut basically need to recreate what it was with a Twist of New of course. It has to be 100 percent Mozzarella. I'm sure some Smuck at Pizza Hut could create a simple but tasty tomato sauce with herbs. They will obviously have to look a bit like Domino's because people like me think Pizza is Pie. Could even have like basic pizza for poor families and like a Pizza Hut Premium Pizza and maybe even a mid range. Basically Pizza Hut if I can get as much Margarita Pizza, Garlic Bread and Salad Bar and unlimited Soda for £30 that is a fair price. Oh and I want chips with it or as we say back in US French Fries. So eat and drink until your stuffed for £30. Sort it Pizza Hut and I will come back and put 5 Stars. You would love that.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
I ordered a pizza to my house and they were 5 hours to get here. And I live 5Minutes away from that place and the food had 7 hairs in it. Worst pizza I've ever had. I'll go to Domino's next time.,3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Ordered the baked ziti.  It was edible, nothing great.  Was delivered hot and fresh.  Delivered on time.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Went to Bugsbys way GreenwichEntrance an issue with crutches to enter, more so if in wheelchair, and no one would helpPerson taking order was brash and rude attitude. He could see we were all disabledThen left to our own devices .Salad not great. Pizza was OKSaving grace was Manager Roxy whom thought ahead and asked if we needed anything .. even got us takeaway boxes as we hadn't finished pizzaThanks for saving the Day RoxyWe found out that the person who took our order was HER manager !!!! 😱WTF!!HE needs to attend customer service course fastAnd the disabled toilets wouldn't flush 😳",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I've been enjoying Pizza Hut pizza for many years so I almost feel guilty writing about one bad experience. But the manager I spoke with said that it is their policy that if they deliver the wrong pizza that they have to charge again for delivery. They gave me a credit for the pizza, which was inedible because it had no sause at all, but since they use a third party delivery service they had to charge me again for delivery. That's another $5.75 plus I always tip the driver. He said Dominos has their own drivers so maybe I'll try ordering from them next time.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"First visit for a while.No cash. All in the app. Trying to work out what to get as I’m gluten free was extremely frustrating. Then placed the order, took ages for it to go through. Internet was poor.Pizza was size of a child’s, tasty but small. Couldn’t have any salad as the amount of cross contamination.Staff who served and cleared plates were lovely.Won’t be going back as they have in my opinion gone too far as as app only eatery.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"The food slowly gets worse and worse every time.. sometimes terrible, sometimes decent, used to be great.. but im not here to complain about the food.. its the damn prices!! I get pizza hut all the time for the fam. What always cost us a little over 30 just cost us 50.. im livid right now. Its hard enough out here, these big rich ass franchises dont need to rip off the little guy, you wouldnt BE a franchise without US.. and im pretty sure you can afford to not rip us off. I hope all these places that take advantage of rough times and jack up all the prices, i hope they all get too expensive and lose all our business and end up losing their businesses.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Pizza was hot, fresh and fairly tasty. It was, however, a very poor value. We ordered a large chicken and bacon pizza. The ingredients were quite skimpy for a pizza that was just shy of $28.00.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Sometimes sauces too small compared to other pizza manufacturers on the market, best value in actual pizzas otherwise",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"Not impressed order a large pizza for my brother it said 7.22pm - 7.30pm it was not as bad as some on here . But was  tepid it was 8pm as could not find , this was in billericay.there is no sorry its late nothing.Not good service bring back eat in .Feel sorry for the lads as they get it in tge neck frim customers.  If on time there would of been a tip. Slthough still not enjoyable hardly warm.",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
Stop targetted online ads. People are not going to go to a business that spams a targetted ad that hijacks their device and interrupts what they were doing. The gig is up we are done with companies selling our individual data for reasons other than us spending money at your business and manipulating us with subliminal techniques as well as distorting social and peer pressure thru our devices. Usually good pizza but its expensive and they need to back off with aggresdive ads I bouycot companies that do this.,3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"I always ask for BBQ sauce instead of the tomato, but 2 out of 3 orders arrived with tomato sauce....",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"The crust was good, the cheese and topping was good, but there was no detectable tomato sauce.  Are we required to buy dipping sauce for this pizza?   Pizza is not pizza without pizza sauce and this pie had none",3,restaurant,Pizzahut
"The price was higher than the one in Murfreesboro that I had about three weeks ago. The one I went to is the Springfield, Tennessee location that has just opened up. I resent the fact that there is a price difference also the portion given for the to go box on the bowl Was way way, way less than the portion that I received the day that I ate in the restaurant in Murfreesboro. I also resent that.The food was very tasty. I ordered white sticky rice instead of fried rice and although it was good, it was also dry in places so it was inconsistent throughout some. Some of it was good and sticky and other areas of it were just dried out. The people were friendly. The service was quick All in all for the bowl and an order of crab Rangoon‘s and an order of vegetable rolls over $14 is too high to spend for the amount of food those in the bowl.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Panda Express is a large chain with many franchise owners. Some of them are just awful and some can be pretty good, especially when you are in a hurry.We eat there maybe twice a year and we know which ones to avoid at all costs. It is a buffet line, but it is not a buffet. They have different prices for different amounts. For example, you can get a 3 item meal or more. They have a decent selection of drinks and the service is pretty nice.Last time we went, we did take away. We had their orange chicken which was very good, the egg roll was overcooked and that sucked. The white rice was fine, just average, but fine. I did like the shrimp we ordered, it was not over cooked or over friend. It was good.Parking is pretty easy. They can get crowded, but the line moves fast.We will go back again when we just want some sort of bland, but decent food.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"For me to find eggplant tofu, I have to go out of the way. Gone is the Beyond chicken. We are back to broccoli as the only plant based “protein” option in most of the United States. Way to alienate people who started recommending you to everyone and now has people asking me why I did.Panda Express, please give us something plant based again. Millions of people live in food deserts or travel. You are letting down so many.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I eat at panda every week sometimes twice a week as well as my sister and her children. The one thing that I do always have problems with at this location is their portion size you pay extra for pretty much everything that they offer is an up charge however, especially when I get the steak I get maybe three pieces of steak and then the rest of it is The rest of it typically peppers, not even the mushrooms. It’s usually just stuffed with peppers so it looks like they put a bunch of meat in it. That is definitely something I have an issue with every time I eat there. However the manager Frankie does always take such good care of any situation that I do have. He definitely is the best manager that I have had to deal with at any fast food location in the area, he is an asset to your company that is for sure.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The name of the game at Panda Express seems to be how many veggies can they load up in a portion of whatever meat. Result being you get less and less meat. Only so much can fit in that measured scoop that is a portion, and 75% of it is veggies. Not cool, and I really don’t know why people go back, except maybe vegetarians. Pretty expensive plate for veggies.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
I went to Panda in Santa Fe today. Got 2 boxes of food - I make my own rice.The orange chicken was not good & at least 2 pieces were mostly gristle. I wont go back - ever.,3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The food is far from authentic Chinese food. But there are a few dishes that taste OK. Different staff give you different portions of food, which is not good. Prices are OK.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
Panda Express on Sahara and Decatur fried rice has no flavor at all. Needs more then it would be good,3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
The food at Panda Express is good. However the costumer service could make room for improvement. For one thing when I go in the restaurant to place an order. They don’t really give you enough time to look around at what they have before you buy. They just expect you to know what you want when you come in. They don’t even really take a minute to go over the different types of food that they have. They are quick past and not in s good way they move to fast when it comes to your order that they miss things that you probably wanted to add in your order. There too quick to charge you for the food. This place costumer service  isn’t very first time friendly. They should at least spend five minutes and go over the different sections of food and give you more choices it’s almost like they pick for you and they assume what you picked is all you want. The costumer service needs some redevelopment and needs to be more patient. Especially if you want the costumer to spend money.,3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I wish they had more vegetarian choices like egg fooyong, string beans with garlic, etc.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The food isn't bad for the price but just like anything else it's going up and fast. I've noticed a decline in their ingredients as well. The chicken seems to have more and more batter and less meat every time I eat there. Disappointing I really enjoyed this place at its peak when I didn't have time to go to a sitdown style restaurant, and I don't like take-out sitdowns because it's just never the same IMO.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I love the food but the service needs improvement. Also, please improve your Honey chicken, they were served in very tiny portions.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Store Location: 24 street and Baseline, Phx, AzLove the food. Hate the Delivery service they outsource to Door Dash.  Ordered online almost $150 and Door Dash Driver never did delivery, but per the tracking on my phone, she did (Jennifer). Call Door Dash was told it will take 7 to 10 to get my refund placed back on my credit card. Do not like my credit number being passed around.Panda needs to find a more reliable company with honest drivers to deliver their food.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
They have an OK salt chicken here. I will get it again,3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The taste of most dishes is pretty good. However, most of the time, my plate is not filled enough.",3,restaurant,Pandaexpress
Why is the Coffee Roll,3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Kind staff but mediocre experience overall.,3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Now the queues have settled down this is a fantastic little drive through. Coffee is great and their donuts to die for! I just wish they can increase the serving of their coffee and fill up the cup full.,3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
i like the overall quality but i will advice them to make the management better because their team are bit lazy for handling hyped situations.,3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"The selection of Donuts is large. But hey what about doing the simple standard good old fashioned Donut sprinkled with Cinnamon? Not to be seen which is a shame. The regular coffee is £1.20 and its a big one! However, this ain't an artisan coffee shop and it comes out of a choose and push button machine (like those in a supermarket). So don't expect a lot ....... but hey its cheap and comfy and cozy in the shop on a freezing cold day.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Relatively inexpensive, wouldn't go there often though because of the customer service",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Sad that corporate greed is making everything so unaffordable. Great coffee but donuts suck now. Ty for the donut coffee special u have but pls make more affordable specials cause we do love u but hate the over prices and skimping on donut fillings. We know as customers what things cost and know who's taking advantage of us. Ty for the companies that aren't doing that as they will be the last ones standing. Far and few between. Shout out here to Domino's, and Little Ceasars for making families still able to afford a nice treat and great pizza.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"I dropped in to the Dunkin Donuts on Hwy. 55 in Holly Springs,  NC to have lunch and coffee before my doctor appointment. Food was good, representative’s attitude was good, but the music was so loud it was distracting and annoying. A manager was in-house and did not seem to notice.Blaring music is not conducive to a good customer experience.Finally, business was far from heavy, yet the customer eating areas were littered with paper and food.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"I have always loved dunkin donuts, but they have no gluten free products so my family now is out of luck.  It would be very easy to have gluten free donuts like those sold at supermarkets in individually wrapped packages so that they would not be contaminated at the locations.  Charge a little more for them.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"I used to love Dunkin' donuts until my blood sugar problems started. You have too much sugar in donuts and syrups. You should do something with this. Now I try to eat donuts very rarely, although I really like the taste.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Food tastes like a$$, really greasy and minginGot an iced tea and it has about 2 pints of sugar in it, and when I asked them to make it without sugar they acted like they didn't speak English anymore",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Have tried better donuts, but when you have no time its okay to go to dunkins",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Avocado toast the taste is fine not all that,  not worth $4.63  Waay over priced for one small piece of toast with a few crumbs of bacon won’t be doing that again.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Used to be better. Everything is so overpriced.,3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"They've gotten bad.Donuts are smaller in size and more expensive now. They also taste like plastic chemicals, not even actual pastries.Coffee is still good but it's too expensive. $3 for a medium? Are you kidding me?It's still good but it's only a matter of time they start cutting corners with it like they did with their donuts.",3,restaurant,Dunkindonuts

I tried it last month and it's doesn't taste the same. Something is different with the crust. It used to be thicker and chewier. Last pizza I got looked like a thin crust pizza 😟,3,restaurant,Papajohns
Expensive prices for mediocre pizzas. Not too shabby but nothing spectacular either.,3,restaurant,Papajohns
The food is really delicious but the delivery wasn't as fast as it should be.,3,restaurant,Papajohns
not so good last time,3,restaurant,Papajohns
Papa Johns are very good but Unforenetly most of places we order from have bad workers. I ordered online once I was at work and I put the time when to be picked up I saved and sent it o my grandma. My grandma arrives and the pizza was sitting there and the workers were rude to her saying the pizza was done two hours earlier. They ended up making new pizzas but please make sure your employees read the order slip right.,3,restaurant,Papajohns
Deliver too early or too late and they get an attitude if you complain,3,restaurant,Papajohns
"I dont usually stop by to leave a bad review, but my last order was really disappointing. Please, please work on the quality of the food you feed us with!",3,restaurant,Papajohns
As far as pizza chains go... I'm kind of in love with some Papa John's.  This location in particular is great.  Everyone has always been nice.,3,restaurant,Papajohns
"Their cheese pizza with jalapeno and olive toppings was great. It was delicious, though not as much as many other local ones. Some upgrading in terms of taste and quality would help them, for sure.",3,restaurant,Papajohns
"We went to the Chipotle in Harrisburg, the one near Fairfield Inn and Suites. The food and service was fine, very good actually. What grossed me out was every table needed to be cleaned and the barrels were over flowing g with trash. The drink area was trashed as well. There were enough employees there to cover breaks so why are there not enough employees to c mean the horrendous mess in the dining room? A very poor standard. We are visitors and will most likely not ever go here again. I love Chipotle food, hjyst don’t like sitting g in filth yo eat if",3,restaurant,Chipotle
"Fallen into the same hole that other food fast food places have. Loved it,liked it and no can do without. Pay your workers a good pay a fair pay so they don't have to feel like they need to steal it from you or ruin your name and see the difference. I will bet on everything the difference will keep you out of the hole.",3,restaurant,Chipotle
"Chipotle can be a hit or miss depending on the location. Some places have fresh ingredients, good portions, and friendly service, while others can be inconsistent in quality and cleanliness. It really depends on where you go. Overall, it’s a decent option for a quick meal, but experiences may vary.",3,restaurant,Chipotle
"I usually like Chipotle but it's always hit or miss. The last 2 times I went to the Des Peres, MO location, they didn't give me my guac with chips even though I was charged for it. The chips were also stale and disgusting. I will be taking a break from this place until they figure things out.",3,restaurant,Chipotle
"I love the food at Chipotle but they always seem to be out of key ingredients or skimp, even when you ask for extra!",3,restaurant,Chipotle
They’re still skimping on the portions. Still one of my favorite spots.,3,restaurant,Chipotle
I went to the Chipotle at the O2 and the burrito bowl was great however the useless wooden spoons that they provide to eat the food are horrible. It was rough and left a horrible splinter in my gum which swelled up and took days to recover. Be very careful with those,3,restaurant,Chipotle
"I was at the 117 location in Lima Ohio on may 17, the place was dirty & my food was cold! When I ordered the bin of Barbacoa was empty. The server said he would be right back. He went to the back of kitchen & took my half finished bowl with him. When he returned, my bowl now had meat? He finished my bowl & when I went to eat it in store, it was cold! I won’t be returning to this location anytime soon! Location is poorly managed! Guess you can attribute it to the younger generation & their poor work ethic & manners🤷🏻‍♂️",3,restaurant,Chipotle
Pretty good food but it really depends on where you go,3,restaurant,Chipotle
Employees are pretty good and most try there best but 90% of the customers are the problem so,3,restaurant,Chipotle
"My small .town recently opened a Chipotle restaurant. The locals have been pouring in!  I used to live in the Phoenix metro area, so I am very familiar with Chipotle, and have enjoyed many meals there. Excited to try this new one, I waited until the initial couple of weeks passed, and finally gave it a try.  Food was tasty, as expected. But, my burrito was cold inside.  I brushed it off, and went about my day.  Several days later, I decided to try again. Another burrito.  Again, cold inside.  So, being a long time customer, I tried contacting Chipotle using their online form.  Impossible.  So, I turned to their online ""assistant"".  Not able to get that done either.  I left all my personal info.  No response by phone or email.  I was simple trying to help save this local restaurant.  Apparently, they could care less.  Location: 108 North Beeline Highway, Payson, AZ.",3,restaurant,Chipotle

"I went to the Chipotle in Coronado, CA at about 12 noon on a Monday, 5/23/2022. Their was trash outside the front door, trash on the floor inside, the food areas were dirty, the workers were inattentive, did not greet me, were slow to fill my order, seemed unfamiliar with their work. But the food was good, as usual. There was a ""Help Wanted"" sign on the door. Obviously, there is a labor shortage with the people who are working not appreciating that they even have a job. The owner should step in and clean up this mess; it is ruining Chipotle's reputation.",3,restaurant,Chipotle
I ordered it through Uber App ... way less then expected but test was really good just too less almost half bowl salad.,3,restaurant,Chipotle
i asked the guy if he could put extra cheese on my bowl. he went ahead and put a small amount after i said extra . i replied with “could you put more please “ and he then replied with “that is extra but ok” very very rude,3,restaurant,Chipotle
"Good evening, my only problem is how the workers are handling the food without gloves. For hygiene purposes, the company should ensure that gloves are delivered to all branches. The cashier was a pleasant Young lady so I was pleased with that. But please let there be a change in what I mentioned above. Thank you.",3,restaurant,Dominos
"Ordering is fine, but I can NEVER LOG INTO THIS SITE... refuses to allow me that function. So, all my points are inaccessible. THOUGH they do allow you to log in through an email link, but that's not technically tied to your actual log in... It's annoying. Also check out sucks... There's like 50 fields you have to go through just to check out. ""Do you want to round up"", it just gets a little obnoxious ordering online.",3,restaurant,Dominos
This leads to the conclusion that they want to hide something maybe unfresh ingredients. But to be fair not everytime it was like this.Spicy pizzas are the best here,3,restaurant,Dominos
"It is what it is. Quality has been declining and prices up. I walked in into my local store the other day and, yes the place is neat and clean. But the pizza itself is not worth the price anymore.I got a regular cheese pie. The crust is too chewy and the sauce pungent.",3,restaurant,Dominos
Service great.Corporate Portion Size to Mac and Cheese and Lava Cakes is quite small and inequitable to the cost. You need larger portions.,3,restaurant,Dominos
They rip customers off on delivery as well as the delivery driversWhy is dominos charging me a fee for delivery? It’s the employees vehicle being used! Your lousy fee takes away from the employees tip and their earningsDo better dominos,3,restaurant,Dominos
"Yummy pizza, the delivery guy isn't always happen to deliver to the door though.",3,restaurant,Dominos
Mediocre quality no matter the time or place. I have ordered several times over the last couple of years in several states and each time it has been a disappointment. This was the last time.,3,restaurant,Dominos
"In my opinion Dominos needs to focus less on advertising and more on the pizza. The new, New York style just doesn't come close to NY pizza. The people were nice, the pizza was ready on time but the pizza was a disappoint. I think its a corporate problem not local. The employees did the best with what they have.",3,restaurant,Dominos
"Could be better , as prices are increasing but quality keeps decreasing. Missing the good ol days !",3,restaurant,Dominos
"Ordered 4 large pizza's for local scout group, While the youngsters enjoyed them, which was the plan I would have not describe them as the best pizza I have had, along with much cheaper ones available just a few minutes away.",3,restaurant,Dominos

Dominoes Abingdon UK  - pizzas great.  Fries £4.99 not enough for one person and cold what a waste.,3,restaurant,Dominos
"Not my best experience in eating out for sure.The flour itself is a drought by itself, and the ingredients are fatty tooThough have nice desserts with cinnamon, yum!",3,restaurant,Dominos
"Ordered the $6.99 each special…it was anything but special!  Philly Steak Sandwich had cheese, onion, pepper and mushroom.  Could hardly find any steak but the grease was plentiful.

I still have a feeling the Quarter Pounder has E. Coli in the meat...",3,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"Burgers and fries are the same as everywhere in Mc Donald's, but prices in Georgia are way more high than in Russia, for example. However, they have a special bonus program thal allows me to accumulate my bonus points for each purchase and get some discount later. The annoying thing is that every time I order, my order number disappears from the display shortly, or it appears on the ""ready"" side when actually it's not ready. It disappears even from there too! What a nonsence.. I have to stay there at the desk and wait until it gets done. I also have to ask staff about my order and they always say kinda ""wait a bit, please"". This is weird.. Always! It's the second reason for rating it lower.",3,restaurant,Mcdonalds
Typically a good experience here at my local mcdonalds. They are consistent and you know what to expect. Prices are getting kinda high now,3,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"Thought I would have a big mac as a treat. The burger was thinner than half the bun, sauce was only just there. I won’t waste my money again, so disappointed. I suppose with a qtr pounder you know the weight of the burger.So beware if buying as really it’s a bun!",3,restaurant,Mcdonalds

"It was really good , even though they took a long time",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"Mediocre experience (ordered for 4)  - Whilst the food, although cold, was actually very nice, the portion sizes were only fit for a field mouse. XL chips only half filled the box, and seemed to have less chips than the regular portions on the other meals ordered. The Tacos were almost not there, a whole cm in thickness, sure they are supposed to be stuffed. Regular fries by the way seemed to be the same size as a kids portion in a happy meal. Food - tasted great, portions, pitiful. Not likely to order again.",3,restaurant,Tacobell
The quality of the tacos need to be enhanced now!!,3,restaurant,Tacobell
"The services was fine. I got the the 9 dollar box. SMH ! I will never pay 9dollars for that box again. Its not worth it. I feel that Taco Bell keeps getting higher, but lower quality of food and less of it.",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"I love the idea of Taco Bell, and its interesting menu. Unfortunately it never meets my expectations. If only I didn’t have to hunt around for the minute amount of meat in their products….More meat please Taco Bell!!!!",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"Ok so 5 keosk, 2 registers, about 6 people standing in back. Only 1 person a keosk. I had to ask to be wrong up...i dont work here. Limited seating. Handicap table taken up buy i guess worker with looked like school stuff but not there, and 2 others working on tablets maybe app for taco bell. Few days old mens room already dirty n soap almost out. I think he was the manager. No thank you no smiles. Fine but shrink flation on cheese cups. I also asked for something something very simple but he was apearing to be so agervated. I give it 2 moths it will be dirty again n re stafed. Only gave 3 because food seemed fresh. 1 lady was at least wiping tables. Taco you had more than enough people here to use humans to ring up. I dont wanna ring up nor was i trained for it im old. I probably wont be back maybe 1 more time. Shame they were so good years ago. Yes of course to be expected i guess more expensive i think. Unfortunately im sure they dont care no one seems to anymore",3,restaurant,Tacobell
Didn't try the food as we left as there was no option for hot drinks,3,restaurant,Tacobell
I mean what do they put in this food I had explosive diarrhea.,3,restaurant,Tacobell
"Hot sauce is not even medium hot, lol",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"After DoorDash messed up the entire delivery order, they remade my food when I showed up and gave me a refund! Thank you Taco Bell",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"This was my first time visiting a Taco Bell Cantina, and here’s my take… It didn’t really feel like a cantina, more like an online pickup spot with some seating. That said, I’ve always loved Taco Bell’s food (biased, I know), and being in Times Square made it feel extra special. I went early in the morning, so there were a few people wandering around, but it didn’t bother me. I’d love to see a cantina pop up in my hometown!",3,restaurant,Tacobell
"Ordered 2 combos tonight 9/15/25, seems like there is a major disconnect with quality control, how do you get cold fries in a busy drive thru,and the ice dream is a joke it's a kiddie cup off the kids menu, fast food is expensive, a little attention to detail would be great, other than the it's my pleasure tag line",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
The atmosphere was friendly and busy in St. Louis Missouri.    I was given a gift card so treated my mom and I to lunch.  She was satisfied with her chicken sandwich but mine was so so.  It tasted okay but the bun fell completely apart.  Trying to eat it was rather difficult and extremely messy.  Considering the price I expected better quality.  Not sure if I will return.,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Very expensive and not a lot of food.  Very mid range taste, far better choices elsewhere.  They do chicken burgers, spicy chicken burgers, nuggets, waffle fries and drinks in their Lisburn branch, that's it. I don't know about elsewhere but after all the hype, tailbacks on the motorway etc, I was severely disappointed with what I got.",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I used to get a big fat chicken sandwich, now I get what looks like chickren breast sliced in half, so thin and the bun looks like a slider it's so small.  Still tastes the same but very few fries.  It's not like Chick Fil A is hard up for money they have to slice the chicken in half They need to go back to the way it used to be",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
it is good but coming from me not the best love the quick service nice healthier than other fast food places,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I do enjoy the people there really friendly but the time it takes to get the food could use some work, aswell as the food itself it took me maybe 10 15 min and my food was still a little cold.",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
I was at chic- fil-a yesterday getting dinner.i came through the drive thru and ordered the chic-fil-a  combo with  a side order of mac& cheese.the.sandwich was a grilled chicken sandwich.everything else was good.,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Bring back large coffee!!! I’m a signature member with over 10,000 points and I’ve stopped going to Chick-fil-A for breakfast altogether because no large coffee is available.",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
Chicken could have been cooked a little more,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Am sad to say, I had someone taking my order that was rude/ irritated. Thankfully the person that gave me the food was what I considered the norm (being courteous).",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I can't believe I  drove all the way there to use my free gift card you all gave me, for the employee to tell me it's expired. I ask to speak to the manager and he refuse to let me talk to a manager. So I drove off and said that will be the last time I'll be there. You all want miss me you all have plenty of customers!",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
Food is always good with the exception of the fries which at every location are consistently under cooked and tastes and feels like eating soggy cardboard.Drive through process is exceptional,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"We went to Chick-fil-A at the RSA tower in Montgomery. Waited a while for our order, because they were busy.My husband got our food set down to eat and the chicken sandwich was cold. He said I didn’t pay $17.00 to eat a cold chicken sandwich. So he took both of the sandwich back. We waited five more  minutes the guy called my husband back to get the sandwich’s and they both was cold . I told my husband I hoped it don’t make us sick. We ate them,but an hour later it didn’t stay with me, because the sandwich’s was not at the right temperature.I’m really disappointed in this restaurant!When you take food back ,because it’s cold you would think you would be served hot food. Lorreen",3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
foods great and service too when they are not too busy.  sometimes too popular and the lines are kiinda long when you most hungry..,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
First time with the original chicken sandwich.  Very disappointed how soggy the bun was and the fries are limp,3,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I like 5 guys, usually very good. Not today. The tomatoes were green, not ripe. Why would you put them on a sandwich??Eastvale ca.",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
Okay food could be warmer chips were only Luke warm,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
Fries are good.  burgers and service could use a bit of work,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"While this is a burger and hot dog joint, the lack of option for vegetarians is crazy. They only offer an increasingly overpriced grilled cheese! The milkshakes were amazing though and the customer services was fantastic!",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Ordered a Five Guys burger and fries through Uber Eats, but it just doesn’t compare to dining in the restaurant. The food arrived lukewarm and needed to be reheated in the microwave. Not the experience I was hoping for.",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
The food was mediocre but the free refil cup was amazing love the dr peper but the toilet was a little freaky,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Still better than competitors, but smaller burger joints do much better value for money.",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
I love the five guys hand formed burgers but tonight my burger was a pre-formed burger that wasn't worth the price. It was very disappointing and I will think twice about buying burgers there again.,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
Food came out fast and hot. Service was a bit slow. Place was clean and fresh. Thanks for a great burger.,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Overall they no longer live up to the expectations of what they used to represent, effing good homemade burgers. I do hope they make a comeback",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"THEIR ICONIC CHIPS HAVE BECOME SAGGY AND STALL : (ALSO, THE ECONOMY IS HITTING HARD WHEN THEY GIVE YOU HALF OF WHAT THEY USED TOO... VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE FOD",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"The location in independence mo on south Noland rd had gone from a solid 5 start to 3. Yesterday I ordered little hamburgers with toppings. The quality of the burger was very good. They were barely any grilled mushrooms, 2 per burger, and fewer onions than on the competitions hamburgers. I’m spending quite a bit of money here, and I expect a generous amount of toppings. Raise the price 50 cents a burger if you have to, or charge a little for the toppings if your profit margins is tire issue.",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Pros :-Great Burger - Great chips. Try Five guys chips not the Cajun one. Their Milkshakes are very tasty. You can even add bacon to milkshake! Trust me that's very yummyCons:-Waiting time  -  on peak hours you may have to wait ages holding your token number.Pricey. dirty tables, Not so friendly crew.",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"The Five Guys I go to is in Stillwater Oklahoma, the food is good but every time I go it’s a terrible place to sit down & eat. The general managers name is Eli, he constantly yells at his employees & he’s very rude to them. Everything he says is disrespectful, the employees deserve respect & he shouldn’t be speaking to them the way that he does. His attitude & disrespect should have gotten him fired a long time ago. People like that shouldn’t be put in places of authority over others if that’s how he’s gonna treat them & speak to them. I really wanted to leave a better star rating but with Eli working there, I just can’t. Other than that, the food is delicious! I can tell it’s high quality product!",3,restaurant,Fiveguys
Giving the fries a 3 star rating because they are as limp as a noodle and I understand they like them that way. They taste good but would be better if left in the fryer for 1-2 more minutes. Will not go back simply due to the music being SO loud that you could barely order never the less eat inside. Quite disappointed. Really missing Baja Fresh.,3,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Location on 1910 S Buckner, drive thru never gets the order completed. This is the 3rd time they forget to put something in my order. Taco salad with no chili. Food is always good. It’s the lazy staff not putting a complete order.",3,restaurant,Wendys
"Recently I've bin in one of the Wendy's restaurants and tasted their Burgers. To be honest the meet was dry in burger, i should've go for chicken burger. As for the French fries, it is yummy. Overall, food was edible.",3,restaurant,Wendys
"Tried wendy's at spalding today. What  a disappointment.We got large with not eating all day, very small portions. Got hair on my chip and they tasted of old grease and got started with my burger that was the same full of grease and not very hot, that is all we could teast. Cost £30 for 2 of us we could only manage half. We will never be visiting again.",3,restaurant,Wendys
"Visited Spalding branch , ordered at 9.10 pm ,went to collect order and she said we couldn't eat in and had to take out ,why didn't the machine I ordered on tell  me this and they close at 9.30 pm , ridiculous closing at that time.",3,restaurant,Wendys
"Decided to try Wendys in Southend for the first time. We ordered a double Dave burger and bacon fries each...then an extra portion of plain fries and 10 chicken nuggets to share. Takes us 30 to 40 mins for the round trip so whilst the food was delicious, the extra chips and nuggets we had paid for werent in the bag and it was too far to go back. Great food but much as you shouldnt have to (as you should be able to trust the staff to do their jobs) check your order before you leave or you may get ripped off like we did. Expensive mistake",3,restaurant,Wendys
I haven't eaten at a Wendy's for a while so I decided to stop and have lunch.The cashier was very nice and friendly. I decided on having Chili. What I got wasn't  chili. I would call it Bean chili. It had so many beans in it  and no hamburger.  They need to put some meat in it along with the beans. Very disappointed. This was in Frankfort Ky.,3,restaurant,Wendys
"The service was fine but.... I have always loved Wendy's chili. So I had a craving for  Wendy's chili today. Went to Wendy's on Jefferson in Cookeville,TN today. Was the worst chili I've ever gotten at Wendy's. I've purchased chili at this store before and it was great but today. Nope. It appeared as if they cut their hamburger patties in half. Threw them in the bottom of the bowl and spooned the rest on top. Had way to much meat and didn't taste good at all. Needless to say I'll never buy Wendy's chili again.",3,restaurant,Wendys
Called in today for breakfast which was very tasty but what spoilt my visit was the state of the toilets they where disgusting I don't think anyone as cleaned the toilet bowl in a long time with stains under the lid,3,restaurant,Wendys
"We had a great experience here, the food was served fast despite all the orders. The promised quality is at the rendezvous and the waiters are really nice! I just wish they clean their toilets better.",3,restaurant,Wendys
Wendy’s needs to stop getting of the vanilla frosty & some lemonade flavors. Bring back Hot Honey Chicken Biscuit & keep new items more often.,3,restaurant,Wendys
"Went to a Wendy's on Kingston Pike, Knoxville.  Service was great. We ordered 3 breakfast burritos and was shocked at the price. Over $5 per burrito. That's ridiculous for what was in it.  It had potatoes,  egg (fried) cheese ( like cheese wiz). It was awful 😖.",3,restaurant,Wendys
Horrible service the one in Arlington on n Watson no good customer service.,3,restaurant,Wendys
"First time at Wendy's, not impressed. Visited the Hull Kingswood branch.Reasonably busy, ordered at the machine, a cash option available at the counter.Chicken sandwich and chilli fries, spicy chicken nuggets and cheese fries. Very small chicken sandwich, slice of tomato and a tiny piece of lettuce with a splash of mayo left me completely underwhelmed. The chilli fries we're tasty and enjoyable. Chicken nuggets, we'll can't say much as that's all they are, spice added a decent kick though. Cheesy fries a bit greasy.  Best part was the two frosty shakes, very tasty. Cost, £18, felt little overpriced for what we had. Would I use again or recommend, we'll for a frosty or chilli fries yes otherwise it's a no.",3,restaurant,Wendys
Not the greatest of experiences in the restaurant. The hype is much bigger than the actual experience with this place,3,restaurant,Wendys
I went through the drive through to pick up 3 small frostees. The man taking my order yelled at me that there was no chocolate and there would be no Chocolate for the rest of the day. I told him that was fine and ordered 3 strawberrie frostees. He sighed heavily and told me to drive around. Attitude was extremely unprofessional and offputting. Usually I have a wonderful experience with Wendy’s. But his behavior toward his job made me not even want to purchase anything.,3,restaurant,Wendys
"Visited the new Coventry once for a coffeeand a 'biscuit' (more like a plain scone is that what Americans call a biscuit?) and then for a breakfast.Both times the food and service was good.I ate in but the music was way too loud almost deafening. I'm not saying have no music (It makes a change to have some Jazz and it's connected with New Orleans )but please please turn it down a bit!! Gave me a headache after about 20 minutes.I had to leave the restaurant.There is nowhere to escape the din and the staff must get sick of it,I pity them especially if you don't like jazz!!.Would have given 5 stars but for the music.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
Not nice  Food.They gave us someone’s item from drive through(it was clearly labelled) al the wings were doing was counting as food.Asides from this staff were trying hard really nice and sorted our issue reasonably well and which.Well done staffNkt well done to the flavourless chicken,3,restaurant,Popeyes
I went on 09/24/25 placed an order for 4 smokin rojo chicken sandwichs. When reach drive thtr window asked the girl for sauce for sandwiches. Sd they already had sauce. Got home to eat. All they had were a dap at the end not even in the middle. There was not much taste. Be sure and ask for sauce. They were stingy.,3,restaurant,Popeyes
"We stop at the Parry Sound Popeyes every once in a while after a long trip to take a 12 piece chicken home for dinner. We have another 45 km drive to get home. Every time we ask to ensure that the order has 3 legs, 3 wings, 3 thighs, and 3 breasts. More times then not, we are short changed of a breast and they throw in a dark meat leg. One of us is not keen on dark meet. Yesterday Sept 18, we ordered another 12 peace. and we asked if there are 3 of each and the staff person said yes. When we got home, not so. Next time we will tell them to open the box and show us. Very poor training of staff at this site. We never did get our receipt so we could leave a review.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"Spicy chicken sandwich too saltyI ordered spicy not salty. If I want chicken I am going back to KFCWembley, London, England branch",3,restaurant,Popeyes
Food is not for the best of us very greasy and oily and sometimes they mess up my order whenever I go there. But still a good late night snack.,3,restaurant,Popeyes
"I ordered through DoorDash, the DoorDash experience was great!  Even thought the driver had to turn around twice for either turning the wrong way or missing the turn…  the delivery itself was great!  It made it within the time expected!!The problem with the order was one part of the order was a 3 piece spicy with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The 3 piece was a thigh, drumstick and wing.  The wing was the smallest we’ve ever seen! It might as well have been a 2 piece meal! The mashed potato & gravy side was almost 1/2 if the small container, with a drizzle of gravy.The other meal was a 3 piece tender meal.  The tenders were the bits that were left over.  All of them out together might have equaled 1 full tender somewhere else!!  Again, the potatoes & gravy was almost 1/2 of the small dish.We were so disappointed with this.   We paid almost $50 (before taxes and fees) for the amount of food we could get at another place for almost 1/2 the cost!!!Is this what you do for your DoorDash customers???  So disappointing!!  I don’t know if we will be getting Popeyes again if this is what we can expect!!Do better!!!!",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"I've just had a classic chicken sandwich with a biscuit from Popeyes.  I was looking forward to it, but I was disappointed with the biscuit; it was flat, overdone, and hard.  However, the chicken burger was ok.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"The new Antrim drive through has AI taking the orders. You order, then it asks if your orders correct by checking the screen, then you go to the delivery window and an actual human asks you to check the screen for a second time. It would be faster to let customers use a touch screen. If the orders wrong it’s your own fault. The worst thing about the experience is the awful AI American accent.  Hated it.  I had a Spicy chicken sandwich.  It wasn’t Spicy but was quite crispy.  The KFC zinger is a far superior spicy chicken burger.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"I did a door dash order but I had to call customer support because the 2for1 wings and boneless wings offer never credited to bill. Got that resolve while making order on phone. I was shocked at how tiny the 6peice wings were. The nuggets not much bigger. Each was originally $12.95. I can tell Popeyes cares more about their profits and bottom line than actually, you know, feeding customers a decent portion.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
The food came surprisingly quickly and to a very high standard. However I was less than pleased when they gave me a vanilla milkshake instead of the chocolate one I had politely asked for. When I confronted them about my milkshake they took it and said they would replace it. However to my disgust I believe that they handed me back the same milkshake with no chocolate added. 🫣,3,restaurant,Popeyes
"good food , good service from sahil",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"Went to Popeyes at 6944 Maynardville Pike Knoxville TN on Sat Feb 8, 2025. Ordered 2 and paid over 30dollars for 2 (5) piece chicken tender meals. Drove 20 minutes home only to find 1 5 piece meal and 1 3 piece meal. Minimal fries in each box. Very disappointed.  It was too far to drive back to complain. I was alone in my vehicle so it's my fault that I didn't check before I left the drive thru. I love Popeyes but this is disappointing. I usually go to a different location but that store seems less than clean so I tried this one.",3,restaurant,Popeyes
"Customer service was not very friendly and no condiments were offered. Service was fast,but about 1/3 of the popcorn shrimp were overcooked. Never get a receipt at this location, is this going to change?",3,restaurant,Popeyes
Food OK. Staff didn't give out any welcoming signal. Seem unthusiastic today. Except for the lady who brought food to table.in general my overall opinion after several visits is that staff in general lack the professionalism displayed in McDonald's. Word of advice avoid using the one and only toilet(disabled always locked) at all costs! Rarely acceptably clean! Not much of a pleasure experienced overall today,3,restaurant,Popeyes
"I spent 25 dollars and my chicken was undercooked, the manager had the bravado to tell me they are young birds that's why they were pink.",3,restaurant,Kfc
I went here for the first time in years. Chicken was well cooked and hot. Not enough fries and what happened to the coleslaw? I never got any with my 3 piece meal. Not impressed. The spices on the chicken have got much weaker from what I remember. Won't be back.,3,restaurant,Kfc
"KFC was okay during my visit. The chicken had good flavor, but the texture wasn't as fresh and crispy as i expected. Service was decent, though a bit slow, and a couple of items in my order were missing. Nothing terrible, but nothing impressive either.Overall, it was a fair experience — just hoping for more consistency next time. If they improve the freshness and attention to detail, it could easily be a 5-star visit.",3,restaurant,Kfc
"lags website, order was doing long",3,restaurant,Kfc
"KFC has been one of the classics but it has been harder to decide to order there. The chickens are smaller and smaller, price is higher and service is not the best. I could've said at least the price is decent 10 years ago but this is no longer an excuse",3,restaurant,Kfc
"KFC offers decent food, but the experience could be better. The chicken was tasty and crispy, but the portion sizes felt smaller than expected. The service was okay, though it took a bit longer than usual to get the order. The place was fairly clean, but not as well maintained as it used to be. Overall, it’s an average experience — good for a quick bite, but there’s room for improvement in quality and service.",3,restaurant,Kfc
"The size of their chicken is small, though the serving time is fast.",3,restaurant,Kfc
Luke warm chips and pinkish tint to zinger burgers. Had a bone in one. Salty chips. Got order in under a half hour - Mandurah Central,3,restaurant,Kfc
First off this is the second time the app has screwed my order up.  Only to be informed at store the they have no control over app and basically oh well have a nice dayThen I get home and my coleslaw was turning and was gross.,3,restaurant,Kfc
I believe that the sugar syrup for the unsweetened iced tea must be served with more than 1 sachet.,3,restaurant,Kfc
KFC has really good flavor and the chicken is always enjoyableService is usually fast and convenientHowever the quality can feel inconsistent at times and the fries are not always freshPrices also seem a bit high compared to what you getOverall its tasty but could improve in consistency,3,restaurant,Kfc
The chicken was okay but missing that fresh crispy taste service was fine and the place was fairly clean overall just an average experience,3,restaurant,Kfc
"Just ok! Decent food, service lacking, but people were ok",3,restaurant,Kfc
"This company has shorted me again! I thought I'd give them another try and this time they barely gave me any gravy for my potatoes.  The container wasn't even half full. I expected them to give me what I paid for and got carry out so I didn't check until I got home. Disappointed again! Kirtland,  NM KFC is the worst",3,restaurant,Kfc
"Love KFC but why on earth do they not allow you to use more than one reward per order? If I've earned them, I should be able to use them how I want! Made me do two separate orders in store in order to redeem. Bizarre and very inconvenient. Expect better.",3,restaurant,Kfc
"After work, fresh salats, meat, sometimes they’re bit stingy with toppings.",4,restaurant,Subway
"Subway Ealing Broadway ReviewHow about knew customers?Subway is possibly one of the most healthy fast food places on the high Street.Where there are options for healthy bread, salad, vegetables and non-processsed meats.Unlimited salad on most subs is also a great healthy option.Ealing was clean had space for me time sit down and relax.If the price Point was a bit lower, I probably would go more often.Also, i require a place a i can stay a bit longer and work or do admin etc.So an unlimited soda or coffee option would work better for me in Larger subways.Subway Seem to assume, and Ealing is not exception, that everyone has been before. There is little help or explanation for people who are knew to the concept.",4,restaurant,Subway

Btw, I'm 10 years old. :)Thanks!~Elijah",4,restaurant,Subway
"I'd say that I pretty much like Subway and their branded sandwiches. Today it's faded by some other companies which are worldwide famous as junk food companies, but it's not the matter of my review.I remember those days when I was going down the street using the same route and had a Subway joint to have a snack before job. They had indeed a broad range of different sandwiches and I liked watching them preparing my food.",4,restaurant,Subway
"The restaurant has a variety of sandwiches and snacks like packaged potatoes or cookies. Subway is a restaurant in which the order comes out almost immediately, the food arrives fairly quickly. If what you want is agility and not having to wait a long time for your order, this restaurant is the one for you.There are a lot of different ingredients to add, it's delicious and even though it's a light meal you'll be full and satisfied. Definitely worth a visit.",4,restaurant,Subway

"We love your pizza, store service and delivery.The one thing we and most other people could honestly due without. Is on your screen(s) located over the payment desk. Displayed on the screen far right if your pizza is paid or not.I was at your south London ON., Dundas st. location. Two kids walked past outside probably viewed the screen came back inside, said I’m here to pick up for Pam. Knowing pizza showed paid on the screen.They laughed when they exited and began eating it. They scored a Paid Pizza. That store is now paying for a new pizza  out of the ignorance of someone in your corporation that should have never added the paid section to the screen. ( Leave it blank ) That person would be deleted off the pay roll for costing all stores and satellite locations $$$ of month end profits.Think about this comment, it makes sense.

Don't know why reviews are so low. I usually get great food and service here,4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I stopped by a Panda Express in New York City and was pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, busy but well organized, and the staff handled the rush really well. My orange chicken and Beijing beef were both hot, crispy, and full of flavor. The fried rice could’ve been a bit fresher, but overall the meal was satisfying. Service was fast, and the employees were polite and efficient. For a quick bite in the city, it’s a reliable spot that hits the spot without breaking the bank. Solid 4-star experience!",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I Frequent this spot often for lunch... the Anahiem,CA location typically Food is good especially terriyaki and Orange chicken.  Only negative is super greens are often not available and I have to wait.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I order Panda Express on GrubHub(that's another review) but when I finally get my food it's always good, they do forget items on my order sometimes though which is disappointing but I usually like the food, it's fresh and usually hot depending on how long it takes for GrubHub to deliver it but like I said that's another review, I'm happy with Panda Express though, even though they might screw up a order every now and again, I will continue to order from them.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The panda express on 23rd has one of the best services I've experienced , Everyone worked in a quick manner to get my food out and of course it was fresh , only down fall is i would've liked them to keep the firecracker shrimp . It was my favorite.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"First. Timers and my husband and I were ok with the flavor, but felt the meat portions on the plates could be more, especially when you’re paying more for specific meats.  We enjoyed it though.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I tried Panda Express about two weeks ago for the very first time in my life! LOL.  Well, besides my yummy vegetable rice being dry, my total meal was highly enjoyable!  I believe the honey, walnut shrimp are my favorite! I also like their noodles with the onions.  The servers cared enough to serve me very hot food and I was very happy with that! My first trip was a take out order.  Next time, I hope to dine in! Nice dining area, clean and quiet!  I like them! ♥ :)",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
Their food is pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce tastes like ketchup. The only problems I see is that the staff is inconsistent and sometimes rude.,4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Went back to eat at Panda Express after a long while. The food was just as good as I remembered.  The orange chicken, broccoli beef and honey walnut shrimp were freshly cooked.  Chow mein was a bit oilier than usual.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Good service total came to $ 13:16 then the girl ask me if I want toupchange  so I asked what's that she says they round it up to 14 dollars so I asked her how about if we down change it to 13 dollars and she says they dont do that. That's after she had asked me if I wanted to donate to a charity.   Seriously , new gimmick to keep your money",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
I love panda express it's a healthy meal at a good price 😋.,4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I absolutely love the honey walnut, they are really good! I think the walnut and the shrimp make a good combination!!",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"COVID must have really hit hard at Panda Expess, I ordered a meal and got a fortune cookie without a fortune, twice in 2 consecutive days. I guess it's their way of saying, were going broke..make your own fortunes from now on.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Panda Express is Cherry Hill, NJ is awesome. Food taste delicious however service can get better.",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"The worst food we ever ate, usually we can get 2 meals out of it but instead we threw it away",4,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"Dunkin’ is my go-to for a quick coffee and donut fix. The staff are always friendly, and the service is fast even during busy hours. Their donuts are fresh and soft, and the coffee always hits the spot. It’s the perfect place for a quick pick-me-up any time of day.",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
First time going dunkin  donuts today and experience was great . Had strawberry shortcake 🍰 frappe 😋  it was delicious.,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
The coffee is good I wouldn't eat there all the time but it's good sometimes it can be very busy though,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"It was niceThe coffee isn't good every time, but manageableChocolate donuts are THE best",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"The dunkin donuts on west street in southington near Residence Inn is good. The young lady I believe her name is Gina, what a sweet child, so helpful and courteous, she didn't rush me, like the boy joey did. They should have more employees like Gina. Thank you.",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"I have always loved DD but compared to before, their donuts doesn't seem to taste as great as before. I have visited a couple of other branches and their bavarian has significantly become smaller. I can still say it's worth the price though.",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Very good for me. They are consistent with their donuts' taste as well as their service on their physical store. Great!,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
The donut is delicious but it is too sweet,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Tasty donuts though their mobile app needs work it always is a bit glitchy for me.,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
Amazing donuts and it's very fresh always.,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
always excellent and very reasonable price,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Unfortunately, they close at 4 for now!! Not fun, for long nights!!",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Better Coffee than other chains! Also decent food! donuts could be better, but its cool that they are open 24/7. Real life saver!!",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
I like our local Dunkin Donuts.  They do a fast drive thru.,4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"Delicious donuts and coffee. Wonderful customer service. I'm relatively new, and have only positive things to say.",4,restaurant,Dunkindonuts
"TomatoCheeseDough..Every ingredient is top-notch! However, sometimes the delivery is late, and they don’t give any compensation for that, should work on that.",4,restaurant,Papajohns
"Prices have really escalated.  Can't afford to eat out much.  Eating less slices to make the leftovers stretch to cover more future meals.  Maybe this will help me lose weight.  The appearance and workmanship of the pizza was better this time.  I bought a large epic stuffed crust and medium.  I visited during a slow time, about 3:30pm.  3-4 people greeted me.  There always seems to be a completely different staff every time I come in every couple of weeks.  Maybe this is training store.",4,restaurant,Papajohns
I loved their garlic sauce,4,restaurant,Papajohns
"The garlic sauce adds a nice touch to an already amazing pizza. Fresh ingredients, fair prices, and genuine flavour.",4,restaurant,Papajohns
They always have good promotions and the pizzas are good but I feel like they put very little toppings on it even when we order extra toppings so hope they could be more generous with their toppings,4,restaurant,Papajohns
"They cook well, but the dining area needs to be better decorated.",4,restaurant,Papajohns
"Pizza's awesome but need to delivered on time for 5 stars , there's scope for improvisation",4,restaurant,Papajohns
"Always love their pizza and service. One Friday night I placed the order for our pizza and my husband picks it up on his way home from work. He had to work about 45 minutes overtime so was quite late picking up the pizza. When he got there, they had him wait about 5 more minutes and made him a fresh one!",4,restaurant,Papajohns
"I do a lot of traveling since I retired, and I know I can count on a local Papa John’s for a vacation pizza night for my grandkids! The quality is relatively similar across their locations/franchises, and the flavor of the pizzas is by far the best of any delivery chain I have used. It is definitely a good option for your pizza needs for a relatively affordable price. Enjoy pizza night!",4,restaurant,Papajohns
I have always enjoyed Papa John's Pizza. Not sure why so many disapprove of them. I am absolutely addicted to their spinach artichoke pizza dipped in the sides of cheese sauce they offer for an additional cost! IT IS SOOO GOOD!!! :)),4,restaurant,Papajohns
The reason that I picked 4 stars was heavily on the fact that I feel ledos pizza is better but still.. I give credit to papa john's because it's good`!,4,restaurant,Papajohns
"The service is a bit slow but I always have a great time here, the food is really good too",4,restaurant,Chipotle
The food is good but i think it could be better & they need to start severing more food because they only give a little,4,restaurant,Chipotle
"The mgr Louis more than helpful and professional ***** Santa Maria ,CA",4,restaurant,Chipotle
"I’ve been a long time customer of the chipotle franchise. I’ve spent well over a thousand dollars with the company. For the most part it’s everything you want from a Mexican grill. The only downside is the employees and management. They either treat you like you’re holding up the line or they make you feel like you’re the only one there. But, at the end of the day. when you’re walking out or dinning in with exactly what you walked in thinking about, it’s a great feeling because I know the food won’t disappoint.",4,restaurant,Chipotle
It was good but the tortilla was cold but the rest was good the thing was hit tender so good you should get it but probably the tortilla will be cold.,4,restaurant,Chipotle
"I have ordered from the new Ancaster Ontario location at least 6 times for lunchQuality, portion and value have always been top notch, especially the bowlsAnd they can easily make for 2 lunches with cost under $20.00 totalMostly order the chicken which is best on the menu (have not tried fish)Only sub par experience was the Barbacoa Beef which was far too saltyLot’s of other options though and I am a fan",4,restaurant,Chipotle
"Nice food for its price, quick service, and pulled pork is my favorite. Have never ordered online though.",4,restaurant,Chipotle
Really friendly and efficient team!Pretty cheap for the quantity. I also recommend the guacamole.,4,restaurant,Chipotle
"Chipotle has really good tacos and I can't stop ordering their burrito bowls. As long as they can find a way to start providing faster deliveries, I'd buy from them every time.",4,restaurant,Chipotle
I was recommended to come here by my son. I was very happy with my burrito.,4,restaurant,Chipotle
"Love them, though I wish they did not soak their beans in pig fat as it often upsets my stomach. Delivery service is amazong. $1 fee. Get the app. So much cheaper than door dash or Uber eats. Would have saved me a ton over past year had I known!",4,restaurant,Chipotle
"This is a good store.   They generally provide good food, at good prices, with good service.   There were some problems with the workers wearing masks at the beginning of the pandemic, but I think they have gotten this problem resolved now.   I go there frequently.   Thank you Chipotles.",4,restaurant,Chipotle
The food was good. It wasn't hot or even warm. I followed the driver on the app and he  just sat south of the restaurant for about 15 minutes while my food got cold. Not sure what he was doing. I think delivery should have been faster. I don't think the extra time was necessary.,4,restaurant,Chipotle
Good food makes you want to run in the nearest bathroom,4,restaurant,Chipotle
"The locations near me in Oakland, CA are decent places to get a bite to eat. Their clean and the food is tasty. I’ve had the occasional bad experience, but that doesn’t deter me from returning. I really like the guacamole and always get a side of it to go with my burrito.",4,restaurant,Chipotle
"tasted good a little salty though couldnt put my finger on it, so instead i put my finger IN the dominos delivery guy  :3",4,restaurant,Dominos
"my fav extra cheesy pizza is still good here, though seems that the cheese they use is different.I eat it regularly, sometimes it is my dinner :D",4,restaurant,Dominos
"Domino pizza is all about fast delivery and their uncommon pizzas that can be found only in their chain. Moreover, they even have their own app where I can track my delivery, usually it takes under 30 minutes which is quite fast for pizza delivery. Sometimes it’s hot and perfect, other times a bit sloppy with not enough toppings. Nonetheless, I still believe this is one of the best pizzas in my country. I hardly doubt I will find another one with the same speed and price policy.",4,restaurant,Dominos
"I have no problem with the pizza it’s lovely and tasty, my complaint is I keep asking for it to be delivered to my address which is the back of the main house and your delivery men cannot understand English as they keep delivering it to my neighbour which is not on. I have pizza delivered usually once a week but cannot do this anymore as it is annoying my neighbour. I live in Coulsdon Surrey.",4,restaurant,Dominos
I came to pick up an order last night and stupidly didn't take my card back after paying. It wasn't until I got all the way home that I realised. Thankfully I'm a regular at this branch so they had my number from my order and one of the kind staff rang me and let me know he would keep the card safe for me. Thank you again Paul.,4,restaurant,Dominos
"The pizza quality are fine, so is customer service. However, the website is atrocious to use, consistently freezes up, confusing user interfaces, sometimes just crashes the entire web browser which meant I have to start over again.",4,restaurant,Dominos
Overall they give a decent pizza and show up when they say.,4,restaurant,Dominos
High quality pizza will beat any pizza restaurantIf you want consistent quality from coast to coast this is the restaurantJust introduce free customer WiFi with atleast 1gb so we can order and go on social media while the food cooks as the domino’s pizza in Bangor is near a “airport” aka a hospital landing zone which has directional data blockers so there no 4g or whatever there so your unable to order via the app,4,restaurant,Dominos
"Very friendly staff in the GC branch, went over and beyond",4,restaurant,Dominos
Always had a great experience with Domino's. great meet up place with friends and family.,4,restaurant,Dominos
"I ordered two New York style pizzas for lunch. The pizza is cut into six large slices instead of eight. The pizzas had great flavor, but the extra cheese never seems to be there. I was disappointed that the crust was thin all the way to the rim. I usually eat all of the crust, but this was not soft and chewy. I don't see how it is any different from your usual pizzas other than the cutting of the slices. I'm going to stick with hand tossed. I went to the drive thru and the service was fast and our pizzas were ready.",4,restaurant,Dominos
"Athol, Mass.We have been getting hand tossed pizza at Domino's  for a long time. We always get extra cheese on our pizza and were always happy with it. The last two times,  there was a very modest amount of cheese even though we stressed extra cheese. We called and asked for the manager. We told her the problem and her answer was that the help was over topping the pizzas so, now everything is measured. We told her we would try somewhere else and she said alright and hung up.Very unprofessional.We are done with Domino's.",4,restaurant,Dominos
"tried new wrap yesterday called mixed or something like that, it delicious",4,restaurant,Dominos
"This one is a tough one to rate properly. It all depends on what store you order from. Here where I am at it’s always a hit and miss. Downtown is usually always perfect!! Their pizza is fire!!! But I guess that’s where the boss is usually at. So that makes sense lol Now when we order from the one closets to our place, we usually get upset. They NEVER seem to get the order right! And my pizza is either not done enough or it’s over done. It’s annoying!! But boy oh boy, when they actually get it right my mouth is drooling for more!!! They literally have the best takeout pizza here. Except when they get it wrong. Or do a halfazzzz job and just don’t care. The workers at this closest store should NOT work there honestly. But nowadays places seem to hire just about anyone since nobody seems to wanna work anymore. It’s sad. Good OR bad though… it’s the best pizza around IMO! 🤤",4,restaurant,Dominos
The pizza is usually real good but they’ve come late a few times this year. I know it’s tough to get trustworthy workers in a lot of places though so I’ll stay with them and give them a chance to get things right again,4,restaurant,Dominos
Not a bad experience I would recommend it. They get a lot of hate but I don't see what is so bad.,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
Very fast. Especially for a family of 5. And cheap too. Will say prices have gone up but still cheap and good,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
Their movie-themed floats were refreshing but the flavors are not that unique compared to other drinks. I wished a wider variety of flavors next time.,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"For me, the service is good; it's fast, efficient, and has excellent prices. The burgers and fries are delicious, as are the desserts. I'd like to see security in the restaurants. They have many locations, and the food tastes very similar.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
My family friends loves the chicken nuggets and french fries!!!,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"McDonald's is what it is. I'm not interested in reviewing them, I'm testing this site before I review another company.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
I actually like the app & the deals they have & building points for a free item. Best coffee around too.,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
Last time I have visited in Lahore Pakistan. The food was too much yummy and I m give 4stars bcz service was not good.,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"It is a very nice and cozy place, the workers are very good, they maintain good cleanliness but their cleaning does not last long since people do not help keep it clean, they have a wide variety of products, all of which are very tasty.In my opinion, the workers are sometimes very clueless, they leave the box alone and you have to wait a long time until they charge you for the order, there are few boxes and sometimes they are damaged or there is no paper in the machines.In conclusion, it is a nice place that I would recommend going to, you just have to be patient in case you have to wait but the products are very rich and varied.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
The consistency you guys have with your service I like,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"Whenever I'm starving and I'm super lazy to buy some food and do it on my own, I don't mind coming over McDonalds, why not actually. If you will choose a good combo which will be balanced from the point of calories, then it's even a cool way to have a snack.But, abusing it isn't very good, so you should watch out. Their food is tasty as hell, but you better comply with a measure in this case.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
The food was fast and good,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"McDonald's consistently delivers a fast and convenient dining experience. Their menu offers a wide variety of options to satisfy any craving, from their iconic Big Mac to their mouthwatering McNuggets. The service is efficient and the food is consistently tasty, making it a reliable choice for a quick and satisfying meal on the go.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
"I love their food it's delicious, and also their iced coffee is fantastic. It could be a faster service.",4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
Breakfast is always my favorite here. Please always make your breakfast available everywhere.,4,restaurant,Mcdonalds
If only I was a fan of burgers would eat there everyday! Not bad cafe:),4,restaurant,Burgerking
"I guess people here only leave negative reviews and i don’t know why. I assume the majority people that like and go to BK just don’t bother to leave a review for a brand, a chain that everybody knows it and everyone has an opinion.For me, the best burger place",4,restaurant,Burgerking
"I used to be mcdonald's fan and I really never bothered to try BK but when I did .. oh my god :DI like the taste way better, it tastes like real meat, something that mcdonald's is missing.BK rocks :D",4,restaurant,Burgerking
Tasty but not the best ones. Moderate prices.,4,restaurant,Burgerking
The ambiance was lovely and the food was delicious but their service was not so good.,4,restaurant,Burgerking
BK is second FAVorite out of MickeyD's and Wendy's.Always have the BK coupons coming in the mail. The 2 Whopper Jr full meal for 2 coupon for $5 is a good deal. I like BK fries the best out of Wendy's and MickeyD's.,4,restaurant,Burgerking
I really enjoy the deals and the food at my local Burger King,4,restaurant,Burgerking
BK has the best burgers arround! Loving that tripple whopper and big king XXL! Their brownie with chocolate is also delicious! Deffo give them a try!,4,restaurant,Burgerking
"I frequent the Mableton Ga burger king and I would like to compliment the woman cook with the blonde hair and warm smile, each time I go in she's always working so hard and she's passionate in my opinion about her food for us customers, and some of the staff has that passion also but I do mean just some of them other than her, but great job burger king.",4,restaurant,Burgerking
"I always eat burgers when I'm on the road.Burger King has great offer of burgers, tasty sauces and amazing fries. Burgers are not big, but I'm always stuffed!",4,restaurant,Burgerking
"I usually go to Burger King at night when all other take-away places are closed. Unfortunately they invariable have a large line of people waiting, so it takes a while to get the food. The quality of the food is mediocre at best, but very consistent, and excellent if you have a hang-over.",4,restaurant,Burgerking
"Until recently i didn’t know how good taco bell actually is. I released that i never go to taco bell on purpose, but it is always the best choice when i don’t know what it eat that day. And this is actually big thins for a fast-food place",4,restaurant,Tacobell
"The food was fine, but the employees in the service area were chit chatting and using a lot of obscene words.  This was on Friday, September 19 at about 12:30 PM.  The restaurant was 035722.  I personally don't mind, but a child had been present just minutes before the language started.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
"I know they don’t care about reviews, but here is an objective one… still good",4,restaurant,Tacobell
The gentleman at the drive-through was very nice. It was raining out here. Wish me a safe travels getting home. The food was hot. Crunchy tacos delicious. Craved it. I got it and I’m happy.,4,restaurant,Tacobell
Always the best service always so kind and friendly,4,restaurant,Tacobell
Taco Bell is literally my favorite fast food restaurant it’s quick easy and efficient for me when I’m getting off work or having a night with the boys!,4,restaurant,Tacobell
"It's literally Taco Bell. The food they offer is good, but depending on location the quality might not be up to par compared to others. Their chicken chalupas have yet to let me down along with their grilled cheese burritos. Their menu rotation with unique and limited food items are pretty well, though some are a hit or miss and solely depend on if you like it or not. Overall Taco Bell is if you go to the right location.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
Newport road incredibly friendly and efficient drive through staff Yousef. Asset to the team. Made up for the wrong sauce !!,4,restaurant,Tacobell
"the staff are very pleasant , 2 full meal for 2.50 is a deal , plus it tase so good ,so i all wayes grab somthing to eat at taco bell  then MAC D  its healther , just wish it was open 24/7",4,restaurant,Tacobell
"Taco Bell gets a lot of bad reviews because of high prices, but that's not always true.  I just got a crunchy taco AND a bean burrito (no meat) for under $5.00.  Not each.  Both together cost less than $5.00!!  The taco, did break apart before I got home, but tasted somewhat like their tacos used to taste.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
"I think you get what you expect whenever you go to Taco Bell. The food is usually tasty and cheap. A little hot sauce goes a long way. If you are expecting fine dining, this ain't it. But it hits the spot when you need it.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
"It's Taco Bell. Pretty good spot. Eat tacos. Nothing else to say, it's obviously gonna be slow if its crowded.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
Pretty good customer service and the staff in Newport had me waiting less than 5 minutes for my food!,4,restaurant,Tacobell
"Not that bad.I love taco bell, so I always do online order and pick up from the store. They made mistake for my order several times, but it's pretty easy to get a missing item back when you visit them next time. Overall, I don't undertand why people are giving 1/2 stars here, I think it's at least 3/4 stars.",4,restaurant,Tacobell
Loved the bean burrito. Wish there was more bean.,4,restaurant,Tacobell
"I just got done having lunch at Chick-fil-A. I like your sweet the workers are and I love the food but you can make your tea a little less  strong and you put too much ice in your drinks doesn’t matter to me that ain’t no ice in my drinks anyway but somebody who won’t drink with ice does not want all that in drink just need a little bit of ice not two scoops and it’s a very fun place to eat at I just wish you had more for special needs there I was born with Down syndrome and going in restaurant is very hard for me so please make your restaurant or colorful other than that, you have great service and I plan to eat there a get",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Good food,but sometimes would get my order wrong.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I come here for one thing and one thing only… the soft serve! It just hits different. I rarely get the actual food because it’s pricey and the taste is just okay, but I have to admit, the service is always amazing.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
Nice food great kind staff  but expensive,4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I tried the spicy chicken sandwich for the first time and really enjoyed it. Along with fries and a drink, it was filling.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
There food is very good especially the spicy chicken sandwich is really good but the line is usually pretty long and there chicken is good but not as good as Raising Canes.,4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"it might not be the healthiest chicken meals you can get your hands on but it is definitely a near perfect taste. it is very popular. very good flavor and quality. it offers a great option for a fast snack and the sandwiches and nuggets are great. Even if you visit the US once, you must definitely hit one of their restaurants and taste some of their nuggets",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I like Chick Fila.Shocked at the low score.Their food is great. Excellent sandwiches. Great lemonade. I pass on their fries.Always good service.My second choice for fast food, just after In-N-Out.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
I love their chicken sandwich but I think it got a little overprice lately as in and out still seems like a better place for fries and burger but I do love the sauce they offer lots choices.,4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Just had my first chicken sandwich from this place and it's one of best ones I've ever had from a fast food joint.  Came out quick and hot from the drive thru.  Definitely up there with popeye's, if not better.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I love how fast the lines are and how hot the food is when it's served to you and how you can skip the line by ordering on the app! Thank you for good, cheap, delicious meals!",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"but the people that work there, and run Chick-Fil-a. Most people have given this place low reviews because of the people's views. I disagree with Chick-Fil-a's views as well, but I don't go to Chick-Fil-a because of their views on gay people, I eat there because their food is good. when the employees begin degrading the people they believe are homosexual, I'll change my review.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"Excellent! The only complaint I have is the line at 2:00 pm., the cost was pretty high to me, but you have to taste it before you rate it. It wasn’t too anything but good! It’s a great place to go if you want something good to be picked up! So I give it a 9. Quality was awesome! Thanks!",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
The food is god tier +s rating under rated resteraunt.,4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I love this place, great food, quality, and customer service. Their fries used to be good, now they're just okay. Make sure people look at whose order it is if you're doing a pick up order! This stupid lady just walked out of her truck and took our food without looking at the name.",4,restaurant,Chick Fil A
I get that they are expensive but decent quality and get to choose exactly what you want.,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"big portions. food is acceptable, free ketchup refill. did not had toothpicks",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"I stopped by Five Guys the other day and honestly, the food hit the spot. The burgers were juicy, the fries were perfectly crispy, and everything tasted fresh—not that typical “fast food” feel. What really stood out was how friendly and upbeat the staff were; they seemed like they actually enjoy what they do. The place had a good vibe, clean tables, and the order came out fast. Definitely one of those spots you leave feeling full and happy.",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
The employees were sweethearts. The burgers were good but the fries were soggy and not appetizing at all. It was a first time eating there . We woke this morning and my husband’s cc was hacked for over more than 400 on gift cards. Beware when you go this five guys this could be you accounting for money being added to any of your debit or cc . This is quite upsetting because now we don’t want to go to this restaurant again . The food is good but the security is lacking! Be careful we work too hard for our money for some stupid hacker to take our money and sell or buy gift cards! Makes me so livid the world we are living in!,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Nice place, my son adore it's burgers and shakes",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
Great service and friendly employees,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Would just like to say how helpful Luke was in Five Guys Harlow, expensive for a takeaway but the helpfulness of Luke made up for it!",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Prices are a little high, but the burger and fries are better than you can get anywhere else.I usually treat myself once a month.",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
Great burger all the way and the Cajun fry's are superb!,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
Ya know I only taste four guys in my burger was really hoping for that fifth meaty juicy beefy limited edition quality protein shake in my mouth ya know what I’m saying. But yeah it’s ok. They’re pretty NICE people.,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
Best Burger I've had. They have gotten a bit more expensive lately,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
Great Food! Very expensive in most places in PA though. $10 a burger! Overall though you won't regret it.,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"If you love a burger, you can't go wrong with 5 guys.   It just tastes AMAZING!!However it is greasy and you will make a mess, and the prices are kind of high. However I would choose five guys over any 5 star restaurant any day.",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
I think the format of the burgers is awesome. Very juicy and tasty. Spicy fries is top 🔝But a bit pricey,4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Five Guys hamburgers overall taste great.  The weak link of their burgers is the onions.  Unlike In-N-Out Burgers, which have tangy, sharp tasking onions, the  onions used by Five Guys are overly mild tasting.  They are nice and crunchy, but have little taste.  Other than the onions, Five Guys offers a truly impressive burger.",4,restaurant,Fiveguys
"Tried the fairly new Wendy’s at Lakeside, food was excellent, found the service is good too as didn’t have to wait long for our order. Cooked fresh food which shows in the quality. The staff were efficient with a friendly smile! I personally would go back to Wendy’s for another visit the next time we’re shopping at Lakeside.",4,restaurant,Wendys
"Very happy with the staff.  Very friendly, and accommodating.You can tell the food is a lot smaller than it used to be. Overall I do like the taste.My only real complaint is the wait time in the drive thru.",4,restaurant,Wendys
"I've never had a bad time with Wendy's. Always fresh and tasty, could be a bit more reasonably priced, but you get what you pay for.",4,restaurant,Wendys
"Today, I had my first experience with Wendy's breakfast. I was impressed. I only ordered a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit but it was good. The cheese was melted and the egg was a real egg. I am very pleased.",4,restaurant,Wendys
i believe that their service was at a top standard and i think they deserve more money for how hard they work for.8/10 customer service,4,restaurant,Wendys

"Good staff, two ladies know me well, know what I'm going to order when they see me enter the store. The Manager was on her job keeping the store in tact keeping the store clean,  all items kept up and stocked and take good care of customers.😀👍 Breakfast experience",4,restaurant,Wendys
"Although it is fast food, somehow the menu seems more healthier than the other fast food chains.  What I don't like is sometimes the lack of customer service is jarring.",4,restaurant,Wendys
I’m very disappointed at the service at Wendy’s fist of all how do they have a bathroom for customers how do they have a sign up talking the bathroom is not for the public I’m not the public I was a customer I purchased food this has to be addressed as soon as possible,4,restaurant,Wendys
"I went to get a Frosty because the commercial says they’re $1 right now. I ordered the frosty, get to the window, he quoted me the regular price. I said I thought they were $1. He said, “you should have told me you wanted the $1 frosty at the speaker.” I said do you mean I have to tell you I want the sales price? He said yes, if you don’t, it’s the regular price. The only reason this review received four stars is because he gave it to me for $1, and it was delicious, but I’m thinking wow!  Customer service really sucks these days!",4,restaurant,Wendys
"Very good. thanks laxman, he was very nice. The food is good and not very expensive. Perfect for a big group of young or old people.",4,restaurant,Wendys
"We had a great experience here, the food was served fast despite all the orders. The promised quality is at the rendezvous and the waiters are really nice!",4,restaurant,Wendys
"Wendy's is very good. They have a larger-than-usual menu for a fast food place, and what I like is that there are lots of healthier options than just fries. For instance, they have several salads that are great options for lunch or dinner.",4,restaurant,Wendys
"I've only ever been in 2 Popeye's restaurants, Romford & Ilford, and I must say the staff have always been really lovely, and very helpful, this is a major factor for me in Restaurants, I mean who wants to eat somewhere where the staff are unhelpful & disinterested? (Kfc anyone?) However I do prefer the taste of Kfc, so I'll eat there more often,  but customer service wise, Popeye's wins by a mile. KFC take note, train your staff this way, and you've won the race.",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"Nice quick service, reasonable pricing, the chicken is crispy, friendly service by Danyal at the Tyseley branch.",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"The kids love the unlimited drinks...and the food will definitely fill you up .Great music , sometimes a little bit too loud.Only downside is the price ...",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"Omari was a very helpful waiter and his customer service was exceptional.The food wasn't too bad, although I don't see why they exclude lettuce from their salad, but just put two pieces of cucumber on the burger.",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"Experience was fine.  Food as expected. Service good. Value very poor. $7.50 for the 3 tender snack - - are you kidding me? How does that work out? $1 for the tenders, $3 for prep - - - $3.50 profit?  Yikes. That, a large red beans and rice (maybe a pint's worth) $5.99 and a large drink $3.29 - - - with tax tallies to $17.65. Ridiculous.  Bring back the $6 big box - - - or make it $7 or $8 if you have to.  There I got the three tenders, two sides (small but just fine) and a biscuit.  That was a decent value and would be at a higher price!",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"Went to the Popeyes in Forte Birmingham.  Was a pleasureable experience after Michelle put everything right. My order was missing multiple items (hence the 4 stars), but simply letting Michelle know, she sorted the issues swiftly along with efficient customer service and smiles! On letting her know the 2nd & 3rd time lol, I thought she would become weary & fed up. Not at all. She sorted it once again with brilliant customer service. I left the store a happy customer :) Hey! Food is fantastic by the way and store is kept comfortably clean!",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"I went to a Popeyes in the UK and i'm glad that they finally have Popeyes in the UK. The food was great and the drinks were great. But the ordering machines were annoying, as when you added something to the order, the machine did not bring up a confirmation to say that you added it to the order so I would like them to fix that because I ended up ordering double of what I intended to order. But overall it was an almost perfect experience.",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"I went to Popeyes on Goodman Rd., Olive Branch, MS. yesterday. It was amazing to  see a Store Manager that was on her game. I was in Restaurant management for 25 years, since my years it has been rare that you can go into a restaurant and see that the manager actually has control of the store and that it is not on autopilot. It was clear to see that the employees respected her. She addressed us in the lobby and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. I told her I had asked for mild and got spicy she was right on it. The cashier was new in her position and I did say not spicy instead of mild. I can understand her just hearing spicy. Anyway, she was a breath of fresh air for the times we live in. Keep up the good work!!!",4,restaurant,Popeyes
"Tasty, moist chicken with a lovely crunchy batter. Chips are to die for - love even the plain seasoning.",4,restaurant,Popeyes

"We visited the KFC in Banning, California on our way home from a getaway in San Clemente. We were instantly greeted by the Manager Antonio. He gave us better customer service then the high end restaurants we went to in SC. Courteous,  respectful and obviously takes pride in his work. We need more people like Antonio, hope he goes far in all his future endeavors.",4,restaurant,Kfc

We ordered Pizza which got delayed due to a new employee forgetting to put the order through. On calling to investigate the manager at Reigate Richard apologised and asked did we want any free extras to make up for the delay - we understand that no one is perfect and that these things can happen so said it would not be necessary and we just wanted our Pizza - shortly after the manager himself delivered our Pizza and gave us a £10 voucher for our understanding. We have always found Pizza Hut in Reigate very helpful and friendly and would recommend to family and friends,5,restaurant,Pizzahut

So I got my receipt and called the store and spoke to the MOD Oliver.  Little did I know how wonderful of experience he would make a small mistake that was made.  Because of him I will tell everyone how he took care of me, and continue to go to that one store #3687!  I will driver 10-20 miles if I have to just to go back to that store!!  He was amazing and I just want upper management to know and provide him the compensation he deserves and put it out there that customer service is very hard to find, so if you have someone with great skills such as, take care of them!

"The Panda Express in Newnan is wonderful.  The food is wonderful as well.  If you love Kung Pao Chicken, you will not get it more authentic than Panda Express in the U.S.  Also, an employee named Naomi was extremely helpful and kind.  All of the food was wonderful.  I purchased the family bundle with Kung Pao, Sesame Chicken, and Black Pepper Steak.  I also added the new Firecracker Shrimp as an extra item.",5,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"If you want authentic Kung Pao chicken, this is the place to go. It will be nothing like you have experienced at local restaurants. It is authentic (minus the zucchini). It is hot and spicy. The peanuts are crunchy and help to relieve the heat. I am addicted. What I e gotten at every other restaurant has been a sweet, Americanized dish. This one is real. If you want an authentic dish, try it.",5,restaurant,Pandaexpress
"I don't care how bad the reviews are for this place. Every time I'm left craving more. The Apple Pie Rolls are amazing, Orange Chicken never gets old.

"Their pizza is underrated. It doesn’t matter when I visit their branches, in the morning, afternoon or at night, the pizza is always hot and fresh, the crust is soft and the garlic sauce is addictvie. Delivery time can be slow on weekends though. tHAT’S WHY I prefer just hanging out with family or friends and going there.",5,restaurant,Papajohns
"Papa Johns makes solid pizza and I always go there with my family every weekend on Saturday. It’s kind of our tradition already, their dough tastes fresher than most chains. Their garlic sauce is addictive, I could eat it with everything. Sometimes the toppings feel a bit sparse, though, which can make the pizza feel overpriced. But overall, it’s still better than most other pizzas I’ve tried. I wish I knew their recipe and how to cook exactly the same pizza as papa johns. As a big fan of the brand, I even purchased some of their stocks to support them.",5,restaurant,Papajohns

Yes, tomatoes in general have given me a bit of a buzz before, but there's isn't so bad. I can eat two and be okay. I hope you guys keep using olive oil, fructose free ingredients.

The chipotle restaurant I ate at in Wisconsin was the first time eating at any Chipotle. I must say that I was very happy. The first person I engaged with was a worker who was just a nice person. In fact the whole staff was fantastic. Then the burrito I ordered was so good and filling I had to take some home... In a doggy bag.... I bought two burritos for 21 dollars and it was very well spent. I have referred Chipotle to quite a few people.... Most were quite smitten with both the food and atmosphere. The prices are phenomenal and I enjoyed every minute there.,5,restaurant,Chipotle

Its so much easier when an app fails & the staff let you just pay for it without spending the day getting annoyed st the app.All the staff were on it with smiles & service & this has really encouraged me to come back.

"We use Dominos at Crystal Peaks about once a month. I order using the app and I think it's very good. We are a bit picky with food so I like that you can take off ingredients and replace them with others. I'd never order one at full price but there's usually 50% offers on and at that price, the pizza is good value.Last weekend I  ordered 4 pizzas  for my sister in law's birthday. They were delivered within 15 minutes by a friendly and courteous driver. driver.  All piping hot and looking amazing. Unfortunately on this occasion I was disappointed that mine wasn't quite as ordered. I rang the shop and explained and they offered to refund me for the pizza. I agreed, ate the pizza and 4 days later got my refund. Can't comment on other shops but the staff at Crystal Peaks are very friendly and make delicious pizza.",5,restaurant,Dominos

"So I guess no one likes McDonald's and no one goes there, and still they miraculously manage to stay in business and see them on every corner. I think here, guys come only to leave negative feedback. And McDonald's is not even bothered to reply to them. I love how chill they are. You write whatever you want, we're just gonna keep working business as usual. I guess that’s the best decision they could ever make",5,restaurant,Mcdonalds

It's great to see such commitment to customer service!Overall, I highly recommend McDonald’s for a satisfying meal at a great value. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a full meal, you can always count on McDonald’s to deliver!",5,restaurant,Mcdonalds
I had bought tea through the drive through on the mobile app. We were told to pull up and they would bring it to me soon. My wife and I waited and waited and waited. Finally I went in to find out if we had been forgotten. No. They were making it. After waiting I asked to see the manager. She informed me they were making it. After a time (twenty minutes) one of the line workers came to the front and told her it was broken and couldn't be fixed till the next day. They had no other beverages to offer as the carbonation didn't work on the sodas also. Now you might be saying. You rated them five? Well I contacted the store owner who made it right by giving my wife and I vouchers to get drinks. Yes all I wanted was what I paid for. He said he would address his staff. Management didn't just ignore. That's good business.,5,restaurant,Mcdonalds
I like Burger King. My favorite item is weirdly the fries.,5,restaurant,Burgerking

We love coming here every week after my daughters cheer class. The employees are so nice and friendly. When my sprite didn’t taste right they were so helpful and happy to help me.",5,restaurant,Chick Fil A
"I worked at Chick-fil-a for four years in high school. Great first job, not super high-paying but consistent, and the food is far higher quality than what you might get at, say, McDonald's or Wendy's. Three years after high school, halfway through my junior year in college, I went back to the same Chick-fil-a, and they let me work there a couple weeks. Even with just above minimum wage pay, it was more than worth it for the free meal I got with every shift. That was 15 years ago, and I still love the food.In fast food, these three remain: In-N-Out burger, Chipotle, and Chick-fil-a. But the greatest of these is Chick-fil-a.",5,restaurant,Chick Fil A

Big surprise.£21 for a cheeseburger, fries and shake.What the hell I thought.Then it arrived.A Macdonald's double big Mac would be paled in comparison to this monster.2 or 3 large fries from Macceys would equal the regular fries.The shake so thick it almost deserves to be eaten with a spoon.And everything tasted just rightMy verdict.Hell yeah I'll be back",5,restaurant,Fiveguys

The restaurant was spotless, with great energy all around.The chicken was exactly what you’d expect from Popeyes, crispy, juicy, and full of flavour. The Cajun fries were spot on too. I can see why the brand is getting such a following!Next time, I’ll be trying the drive-thru option, it looked well organised and was moving quickly even during the rush.A great experience overall, Popeyes continue to deliver quality, consistency, and that Louisiana hospitality every time!Can’t wait to see Popeyes continue to expand across Ireland, this one in Antrim sets a brilliant example! 🔥🍗",5,restaurant,Popeyes
